Starting at Newtonian _and by extension all of_ Classical Mechanics, \n2. We must deviate from the origin in three different ways:\n    - a Gravitational interaction related with the constant $G$\n    - a relativistic understanding of the universe itself, content in the constant $c^{-1}$\n    - a _amplitudistic_ dynamics of particles and fields that result in Quantum theories, related to the constant $\\hbar$\n3. All the 3 deviations follow the correspondence principle when the constants are \"_turned on_\" from `0` (at origin) to `1`\n4. There are following combinations of the \"frameworks\" from these deviations (the order of the constants follow their historical developments: $G \\ c^{-1} \\hbar$ ):\n    - 000 Mechanics - (origin) Classical Mechanics (non-relativistic, non-quantum without gravity)\n    - 100 Mechanics - Classical Mechanics with Newtonian Gravitation, Celestial Mechanics\n    - 010 Mechanics - \"Special Relativistic\" Mechanics\n    - 001 Mechanics - Non-Relativistic Mechanics\n    - 110 Mechanics - \"General Relativity\" and Gravitation\n    - 011 Mechanics - Quantum Field Theory \n    - 111 Mechanics - ?Quantum Gravity?\n5. The dynamics in each of these characteristicly depend on the framework they are based on.\n\n#### Theories\n\n\u003e A Theory is a implementation of the mechanics in a given framework.\n\nA Theory must **always** be settled with a framework.\n\n- Electrodynamics - the theory of Electromagnatic fields and charges\n  - `010E` - _Classical_ Electrodynamics\n  - `110E` - _Classical_ Electrodynamics in curved SpaceTime \n  - `010E` - Quantum Electrodynamics and more!\n- `0¬Ω¬ΩME` Theory of Matter, Heat and Fields\n  - Heat: Transfer and Thermostatics\n  - Continuum Mechanics\n      - Solid Mechanics\n      - Fluid Mechanics\n      - Electromagnatic Fluid Mechanics\n- `0¬Ω¬ΩE` Electromagnetics\n      - Electromagnetic Circuitry, Electronics\n      - Optics\n\n#### Statistical Mechanics\n\u003e It transends any framework!\n\n\u003e Statistical mechanics is the art of turning the microscopic laws of physics into a description of Nature on a macroscopic scale.\n\n#### final state\n```yml\nphy/root\n\n\t- 000M\n\t- 100M\n\t- 010M\n\t- 001M\n\t- 110M\n\t- 011M\n\t- 111M\n\t\n\t- statM\n\t\n\t- 010E\n\t- 0¬Ω¬ΩE\n\t\t- 0¬Ω¬ΩE.circuitry\n\t- 0¬Ω¬ΩME\n\t\t- 0¬Ω¬ΩME.continuum\n\t\t- 0¬Ω¬ΩME.fluid\n\t\t- 0¬Ω¬ΩME.solid\n```\n\nMore fields of study and further levels in the hierarchies will be added as the wiki develops.\n\nThe Physics part of the wiki currently looks like this:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/d9lnW7N.png)\n\n\n### Chemistry\n\n#### Organic Chemistry\nLet there be three hierarchies:\n- Organic Formalism\n- Organic Compounds\n- Organic Reactions\n\n\"Formalism\" shall contain the foundational and theoretical formalism aspects of the subject, and \"Compounds\" and \"Reactions\" would contain those things precisely following some category divisions.\n\nThis may be considered a first draft:\n\n```yml\nchm/root\n\n\t- orgform # organic formalism\n\t\t- characterization\n\t\t- classification\n\t\t- molecular structure\n\t\t- electronic effects\n\t\t- isomerism\n\t\t- reaction intermediates\n\t\t- reaction mechanism\n\n\t- ogc # organic compounds\n\t    - ogc.hydrocarbon\n    \t- ogc.oxygen\n    \t- ogc.nitrogen\n    \t- ogc.sulphur\n    \t- ogc.phosphorous\n    \t- ogc.halogen\n    \t- ogc.metallic\n    \t- ogc.poly\n    \t- ogc.dye\n\n\t- ogr # organic reactions\n\t    - ogr.rxn # general rxn: between AX and BY; \"rxn.diazo+alc\"\n\t    - ogr.rplc # replacement rxn: AX by Y; rplc.diazo-H\n\t    - ogr.hydrolysis\n\t    - ogr.hydration\n\t    - ogr.dehydration\n\t    - ogr.red\n\t    - ogr.oxd\n\t    - ogr.conden\n\t    - ogr.elim\n\t    - ogr.subs\n\t    - ogr.rearr\n\t    - ogr.synt\n\t    - ogr.test\n\t    - ogr.reagent # organic reagents\n```\n### Mathematics\n\nIt is difficult, in my opinion to have a strong divisions in Mathematics topics. But we may use the classification developed in [zbMATH Open](https://www.zbmath.org/classification/) with the following first level in hierarchy grouping the numbered classes:\n- `f` Foundations: `03` Logic, Proofs, Sets\n- `a` Abstraction: `05-22` Combinatorics, Algebra, Abstract algebra, Number theory, etc.\n- `y` Analysis: `26-49` Analysis in $\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{R}^n, \\mathbb{C}$\n- `g` Geometry: `51-53`\n- `t` Topology: `54-58`\n- `p` Applications: `60-97`\n\nThis can easily lead to problems, and thus must be handled and refactored in due course.\n\n### Biology\n\u003e yet to be developed further\n\n```yml\nbio/root\n\n\t- king # 5 Kingdom Biological Classification\n\t\t- king.mo  \n\t\t- king.pr  \n\t\t- king.fu  \n\t\t- king.pl \n\t\t- king.an\n```\n\n### Astronomy\n\nThis may be considered a first draft:\n```yml\nast/root\n\n\t- clst # evolution and observation\n\t  - clst.planetary # astronomy and geology\n\t    - clst.planetary.earth\n\t  - clst.stellar\n\t  - clst.solar\n\t  - clst.comet\n\t  - clst.solar sys\n\t  - clst.galactic\n\t  - clst.extragalactic\n\t- cosm # cosmology\n```\n\n### Earth Sciences\n\u003e yet to be developed\n\n### Computer Sciences\n\u003e yet to be developed\n\n\n\n# Resources\n- My Dendron Schemas for the subjects will be added here: [riddyrayes/Dendron-Schemas-for-Systems](https://github.com/riddyrayes/Dendron-Schemas-for-Systems)","lastmodified":"2022-08-13T13:46:58.8433753+05:30","tags":null},"/notes/hierarchical-longterm-wiki":{"title":"Wiki","content":"\n\u003e A Dendron Workspace for building a \"Wiki\" for Hierarchical but Networked, Non-Linear Notemaking and Studying\n\n\u003e [!note] Note\n\u003e \n\u003e A Wiki might have different definitions in other contexts, my definition of wiki might not match with others.\n\n# building the foundations\n\nThe fundamental problem is this:\n\n\u003e Context based notes, for example, lecture notes, book notes, etc. are the first hand-down self-documentation of the topics presented.\n\nThe fundamental philosophy behind this \"Wiki\":\n\u003e After a thorough reading on a subject, writing long-term notes on the learned knowledge is desired. This must be generated free from **contextual bounds** and must be let freely stand on the basis of its conceptual standing.\n\n## further problems that extend the premise\n\n### extremely loose, unstructured set of notes is undesirable\nAn alphabetically sorted notes on topics would be hardly desireable. Unrelated topics with same names would pop up together. Even if all notes are heavily-linked and kept non-linear, it would be a nightmare to actually find some specific note purely by search.\n\n\u003e [!example] Example: similar topics but which differ\n\u003e \n\u003e For every programming language there are the usual data types, classes, etc. which must be separate for each language.\nThus, they must be kept in some sort of a hierarchy.\n\n### highly categorical, rigid (eg: folder-based) structure of notes is undesirable\nStructures must be let changed over time. This is simpler to do when just files under a single folder is concerned.\nThe dilemma of placing notes on topics with mixed-concepts, which is practically all of the Sciences and especially Mathematics, will be a waste of time. The hierarchy must be kept simple and easy. A unending series of sub-folders would not be such an example.\n\n### a mix of the above two is nice\nHierarchy should be allowed to grow naturally. For initiating the wiki, one may choose to divide by subjects/disciplines, and then by the first level division of topics in the subject, however large in numbers they may be. \nThe lower branches of the hierarchy must maintain a value of looseness without loosing identity structures. The hierarchy headers might give a linear list of topics in a special conceptual manner, but the notes itself might not follow those divisions.\nThere maybe two places a note can be, if one relationship can not be prioritised over the other, one can loosen the hierarchy and let the note reside above (or create a or more fake-parents using tags).\nAlso, one possible factor that maybe chosen: the hierarchy, even at discipline level must be cascading style. This means they are ordered from more general topics to specialised ones.\n\n\u003e [!example] Example: Cascading style disciplines\n\u003e \n\u003e There is no real solid wall in the scientific community, hence a personal convention can be applied. All study abstract physical systems, models and theoretical applications can be placed under \"Physics\" discipline. And thus the further practical, experimental or other special applications can be placed under Engineering (like Robotics), Astronomy (like Cosmology) etc. Even cross-discipline fields like Astrophysics can be placed under Astronomy due to this convention. Same for Astrobiology and Astrochemistry, where the abstraction comes as biological and chemical systems for Biology and Chemistry respectively.\n\nThis allows one to have folders for different disciplines.\n### multiple iterations of same topic is undesirable\nThis is encountered while learning topics linearly.\n\n\u003e [!example] Example: Dulpicate encounter of same topic\n\u003e \n\u003e While learning Organic Chemistry at High School Standard, one may learn \"Hydration of Alkenes\" under the header \"Reactions of Alkenes\" and later under \"Preparations of Alcohol\"\n\nThis duplicity is at the core of the nature of the concepts at play here. There may be two tracts (organic reactions and organic compounds) which follow each other and link parts of themselves. One path takes a compound, through a reaction, to another compound. And there are hundreds of reactions that goes back and forth from thousands of reactions.\n\n### Choosing the _most balanced_\nIn this manner the right balance between hierarchy, parents, networks, relationships which keep the conceptual nature intact must be obtained. The conventional education and research literature might impose some different approach, which is simpler to teach to beginners, linearly - but that does not mean it follows the objective conceptual approach. It may be historical approach, or just some cherry-picked topics chosen for a final goal.\n\nThe fight is also between reductionism and holism. Reducing a topic to its bare fundamentals is a good approach but by analysing very broad scale developments and similarities of separated fundamentals broadens understanding of the topics.\n\n### densely linked individuals is desired\nTo keep the nature of links hold value one may choose to use them in fields for querying as a database later. \nInterlinked notes can be of help in discovering hidden connection - gaining wisdom!\nTags might be used as a hierarchical fake-parent which cannot be structured onto the notes because the parents' division have an intersect.\n\n\u003e [!example] Example: Intersecting Divisions\n\u003e\n\u003e Several math topics can be put in three of the major divisions - ALgebra, Analysis and Geometry.\n\n\n## quality test for the pieces\n\nHere's a nice thought experiment for a quality check of an individual note or a range of notes on one or many topics.\n\n\u003e [!tip] Hypothetical\n\u003e \n\u003e You have been assigned to give an exam as a part an life-threatening dare where you will be tested on something that you learned 6 years ago. You did not review this subject in the last 6 years at all. You have been given a binary choice of materials you can refer to during the exam: the whole power of every possible books, papers, articles in existence along with the whole of internet vs your entire wiki of notes.\n\nOne should make notes and build the wiki in such a manner that choice easily becomes the latter option, not the former. üòä\n\n\n# Technicalities for implementing this idea\n\n[Dendron](https://dendron.so) has a hierarchy-first approach which is why it contains the best features to be implementing the wiki on. It can be implemented with a combination of Obsidian and Dendron.\n\n## file naming convention\nI prefer the simple `parent.child.grandchild.great-gandchild` style of \".\"-separated namespace hierarchies.\n\n\n# Further developments\n- Building the hierarchies for various disciplines and fields of study: [Hierarchical bases](academic-curation.workstation.wiki.hierarchical-bases)\n\n# Testing of power\n**TO BE YET TESTED BY ME ;)**\n\n- *test if this wiki can help to generate new ideas (whatever that means?!)*\n- test if the notes can surprise the author thyself\n\n# Resources\nThe philosophies can be further investigated in:\n- \"Evergreen Notes\": https://notes.andymatuschak.org/\n- \"Zettelkasten\": https://zettelkasten.de/posts/\n- [Obsidian for Students - A Two-Phase Workflow - üå≥ Walk in the Forest](https://walkintheforest.com/Content/Posts/Obsidian+for+Students+-+A+Two-Phase+Workflow)\n- [A Hierarchy First Approach to Note Taking (kevinslin.com)](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64/) and by extension his [Personal Knowledge Management](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e9c72b4f-adb8-4f15-a6aa-9f9d81538561/)\n","lastmodified":"2022-08-08T04:05:54.9789192+05:30","tags":null},"/notes/my-books":{"title":"My Books","content":"\n- parent:: [[notes/academia]]\n\nBooks I own:\n\n| Title                                         | Author        |\n| --------------------------------------------- | ------------- |\n| Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol I, II and III | R P Feynman              |\n| Classical Theory of Fields                    | Leonard Susskind              |\n| Statistical Physics of Particles              | Mehran Kardar |","lastmodified":"2022-08-09T21:50:36.1352424+05:30","tags":null},"/notes/shifrin-multivariable-mathematics":{"title":"Ted Shifrin‚Äôs Linear algebra and Multivariable calculus","content":"\n- parent:: [[notes/academic-recommendations]]\n\n\u003ciframe width=\"650\" height=\"415\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL5I-Eyk8l9FHdJUd9UujGcvumjCFPHbrd\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nThis fairly rigorous but very entertaining set of lectures (where the instructor uses blackboard!) explains all the stuff in Multivariable calculus one encounters during the core years of a Fundamental Sciences programme: multiple derivatives, _volumous_ integrals, change of coordinates, and especially does everything in a proper linear algebraic setting (which becomes very important in the long run) and with lots of examples and pictures!\n\n## Lecture videos, notes and textbook\n- The lectures playlist [Math 3500 \u0026 3510: Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5I-Eyk8l9FHdJUd9UujGcvumjCFPHbrd)\n\t- No of videos : 112\n\t- Average length of video : 49 minutes\n\t- Total length of playlist : 3 days, 19 hours, 28 minutes, 18 seconds\n\t- At 1.25x : 3 days, 1 hour, 10 minutes, 38 seconds\n\t- At 1.50x : 2 days, 12 hours, 58 minutes, 52 seconds\n\t- At 1.75x : 2 days, 4 hours, 16 minutes, 10 seconds\n\t- At 2.00x : 1 day, 21 hours, 44 minutes, 9 seconds\n- [Lecture Notes for the course - Multivariable Mathematics](http://library.lol/main/B796E88E85C9FF774C3EF1278B2C19ED)\n- The textbook [Multivariable Mathematics: Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Manifolds](http://library.lol/main/C06BD3E524B1C615AB21927FF8CC490A)\n\n## Outline\n\n\u003e This two-semester class is a theoretical and more challenging amalgamation ...

It includes all the material in MATH 2270/2500 and MATH 3000, along with additional applications and theoretical material. There is greater emphasis on proofs, and the pace is quick. Typically the class consists of a blend of sophomores and freshmen who've earned a¬†5¬†on the AP Calculus BC exam. The text is my book,¬†[Multivariable Mathematics: Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Manifolds](http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-047152638X.html).\n\nStudents who would like some guidance in reading and writing proofs might want to look at a wonderful new book called¬†[How to Think Like a Mathematician: A Companion to Undergraduate Mathematics](http://library.lol/main/E46132BF2DB1C18E7E309CBF5A92A636), by Kevin Houston, Cambridge University Press, 2009.\n\n## Homework\n\n### First semester\n\n\n- [Homework Assignment #1](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework1.pdf)  \n- [Homework Assignment #2](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework2.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #3](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework3.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #4](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework4.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #5](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework5.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #6](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework6.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #7](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework7.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #8](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework8.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #9](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework9.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #10](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework10.pdf)  \n- [Homework Assignment #11](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework11.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #12](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework12.pdf)  \n- [Homework Assignment #13](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework13.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #14](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3500/3500Homework14.pdf)\n\n\n### Second semester\n\n- [Homework Assignment #1](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework1.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #2](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework2.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #3](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework3.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #4](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework4.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #5](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework5.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #6](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework6.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #7](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework7.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #8](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework8.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #9](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework9.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #10](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework10.pdf)\n- [Extra Problems for Physics Students](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework_Vector_Calc.pdf)  \n- [Homework Assignment #11](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework11.pdf)\n- [Homework Assignment #12](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework12.pdf)  \n- [Homework Assignment #13](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~shifrin/MATH3510/3510Homework13.pdf) ","lastmodified":"2022-08-10T19:44:36.1282033+05:30","tags":null},"/notes/why-write-in-obsidian":{"title":"Why write in Obsidian","content":"\nThere are drawbacks to writing in Obsidian for taking notes for Mathematics and Sciences - be it lecture notes or long-term notes. There are two other possibilities:\n- **taking notes in *full-on* LaTeX** and keeping them as PDFs: this is certainly not for everyone\n\t- One can even compile topic-wise notes and embed them onto Obsidian notes: \n\t\t- ![|550](https://i.imgur.com/Lonjhi3.png)\n- **handwriting them digitally** *completely* and keeping them as PDFs: requires a stylus/pen equipped device\n\t- again, we can embed the PDFs:\n\t\t- ![|550](https://i.imgur.com/UrETEFk.png)\n\nBut Obsidian with MathJax, Callouts and Excalidraw plugin provides the perfect balance between the two:\n- ![|550](https://i.imgur.com/TisLGWB.png)\n\n\nWriting in Obsidian in this way provides benefits over each of the individual methods, and more:\n- MathJax is as strong as *full-on* LaTeX.\n\t- LaTeX preambles, snippets, conceal, etc. are available from comunity plugins.\n\t- There is a plugin for TikZ diagrams too in Obsidian!\n- Obsidian notes and the entire vault is **dynamic**.\n\t- Between lectures, one can directly link to previously written notes, to specific pages in documents in the vault. To me, this is a superpower! One can embed them too! Live preview has made this even better!\n\t- In long-term notes, block embedding callouts is also very nifty:\n\t\t- ![|550](https://i.imgur.com/9Qku4Fw.png)\n- Obsidian notes are plain-text. That has benefits over storing them as PDFs.\n- Dataview queries can help create a dynamic table of lecture note details, anything you want to display.\n\t- I used a parameter \"topic\" in the front-matter to list all topics discussed in the lecture. ![|550](https://i.imgur.com/o4AdbO1.png)\n\t- Tags, tasks can be used intelligently to make use of the dynamic queries!\n- Excalidraw plugin is a highly active-in-development plugin and even without a drawing device, it can be used to draw figures, flowcharts and also can be used to hand-write notes!\n- ","lastmodified":"2022-08-13T14:36:34.8292632+05:30","tags":null}}
