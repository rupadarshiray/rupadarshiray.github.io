Exam scheduled on the next day (19th) is _Bengali_ exam. At that moment, the government announced lock-down; which made CBSE announce postponement of board exams.\n\n- #### Beginning of Pandemic March-June 12020\n\t- Started a study of pure geometry, mechanics and other topics in a loose way, left them and again went back to a few.\n- #### July-August 12020\n\t- Introduction to *Action in Physics*\n\t- Fell in love with Fluid mechanics, and started studying Electrodynamics\n\t- Giving IACS entrance at home\n- #### September 12020\n\t- Exam month: JEE Main, NEST, IAT\n- #### October-December 12021\n\t- Unsuccessful to get an institute...\n\t- Discovery of productivity tools like Notion and then Obsidian\n\t- started studing for IAT'21: reading a bit of Biology too!\n- #### January-March 12021\n\t- Study and procrastination became a repetitive cycle.\n\t- Was a out of station for a bit of time, which was of help in mental health. Sitting in home is just‚Ä¶ awful.\n- #### April-June 12021\n\t- \"*Obsessive Study*\": picked up a large topic and worked on it for a few days at a time\n\t- Joined a IAT'21 group inMay, created by MS20 students from IISER Kolkata, they were very helpful and made some good friends!\n- #### August-September 12021\n\t- Exams season 2\n- #### October-November 12021\n\t- While coming back from giving JEE Advanced, on October 4, I randomly decided to watch the statistical mechanics lectures by Balakrishnan.\n\t- Waiting period\n\t- First seat allotment\n- #### December 12021\n\t- Seat allotment and admission in IISER Mohali\n\n# Comprehensive academic development during the period\n## Comprehensive list of what I have learnt\n- **Physics**\n\t- Mechanics in all frameworks and Action principle for dynamics\n\t- First Principles in Special Relativity and Electrodynamical Classical Field Theory\n\t- Foundations in Quantum Mechanics\n\t- Electrodynamical approach to Electromagnetic and Electronic Circuitry\n\t- Fluid Mechanics\n- **Mathematics**\n\t- Calculus (including multivariable)\n\t\t- Limits ~ bits of Œµ-Œ¥ definition, how it helps in several variables\n\t\t- Differential calculus of several variables\n\t\t- Line, surface and volume integrals\n\t\t- Vector, scalar fields\n\t\t- Vector calculus\n## Things I made up along the way\n\n- Framework notation for Physics frameworks\n- a Wiki for Fundamental Sciences using Dendron and Obsidian\n\n## Things I know that awaits me\n\nThe story ends near December 12021, where I get a seat in IISER Mohali, and wait for classes to start on January 3, 12022.\n\n### Mathematics *thyself*\nThe enlightenment of \"actual\" mathematics has brought many \"good at math\" students to tears as I have heard\n\u003e [!quote] [LockhartsLament - A Mathematician‚Äôs Lament by Paul Lockhart](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf)\n\u003e \n\u003e The last thing they want to hear is that math is really about raw creativity and aesthetic sensitivity. Many a graduate student has come to grief when they discover, after a decade of being told they were ‚Äúgood at math,‚Äù that in fact they have no real mathematical talent and are just very good at following directions. Math is not about following directions, it‚Äôs about making new directions.\n\n### Physics\n\n- I kept myself only inside classical physics, now is the time to get into Quantum mechanics, and Non-linear dynamics.\n- But overall, wanted to learn more algebra and generally more mathematics just because without that it‚Äôs no help learning physics after a while‚Ä¶\n\n# Extended write-ups\n\n- [[notes/hierarchical-longterm-wiki]]",

Electrodynamics\n8. Action in the relativistic mechanics, Action principle in classical mechanics (okay only basics) \n9. Lagrangians in Relativistic, Non relativistic mechanics, do a bit Lagrangian mechanics\n10. Hamiltonian mechanics (super freaking important) \n11. Now bit of play around, do cool casual stuff like Electric circuitry, Electronics, digital stuff, etc etc\n12. metric spaces, limits of functions between metric spaces\n13. Function spaces, l‚ÇÅ, l‚ÇÇ, L‚ÇÇ,...etc, basics is fine, understand the vector space+inner product structure ~\n14. ODEs/PDEs\n15. (shouldn't have said 20 pre requisites dyam) how to make khichdi... and usual foods (you'll know if you were in PHY101 group xD)\n16. Topology: connected spaces, simply connected spaces// parallelisable, and another term I'm forgetting... \n17. Dynamical systems, Hamiltonian system as a dynamical system, Chaos in dynamical systems, Chaos in Non Relativistic mechanics~ the fun stuff!‚ù§Ô∏è\n18. Be a bit casual now, do some solid state physics, some heat capacity problems, and how Einstein solved em, and what problems it had~ the pre-Quantum stuff too, do that properly~ etc~ i forgo the names, the Plank to Einstein derivation or something\n19. Statistical Mechanics.\n\t- can't stress it enough\n\t\t*you'll find Quantum mechanics lurking inside Classical Statistical Mechanics*\n\t\t\t- me, just now\n20.

But we may use the classification developed in [zbMATH Open](https://www.zbmath.org/classification/) with the following first level in hierarchy grouping the numbered classes:\n\u003e - `f` Foundations: `03`\n\u003e \t- Logic, Proofs, Sets\n\u003e - `a` Abstraction: `05-22` \n\u003e \t- Combinatorics, Algebra, Abstract algebra, Number theory, etc.\n\u003e - `y` Analysis: `26-49`\n\u003e \t- Analysis in $\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{R}^n, \\mathbb{C}$\n\u003e - `g` Geometry: `51-53`\n\u003e - `t` Topology: `54-58`\n\u003e - `p` Applications: `60-97`\n\u003e \n\u003e This can easily lead to problems, and thus must be handled and refactored in due course.\n\nwhich finally resulted in:\n\n```js\nf. \"Formalism\"\n\t- logic\n\t- proofs\n\t- sets\na. \"Algebra and Abstraction\"\n\t- N\n\t- Z\n\t- Q\n\t- R\n\t\t- exixtence and construction\n\t\t- algebra\n\t\t- plolynomials\n\t- a.matrices\n\t- a.polynomials\n\t- a.combinatorics\n\t- a.groups\n\t- a.vector spaces\n\t- a.number theory\ny. \"Analysis\"\n\t- analysis on spaces\n\t\t- R\n\t\t\t- construction\n\t\t\t- real functions\n\t\t\t- real functions.single\n\t\t\t- real functions.multi\n\t\t\t- limits\n\t\t- analysis on metric spaces\n\t\t\t- functions between metric spaces\n\t\t\t\t- limits of functions between metric spaces\n\t\t\t\t- continuous functions between metric spaces\n\t\t- analysis on vector spaces\n\t- analysis on systems\n\t\t- dynamical systems\n\t\t- PDEs\ng. \"Geometry\"\nt. \"Topology\"\n\t- metric spaces\np. \"Applied\"\n\t- statistics\n```\n\n\n\nAnd it eventually lead to problems, as visible from the multiple presence of a note on `R` (the reals) under Algebra *and* analysis.\n\nIt was also difficult to write on `metric spaces`, the definition had to kept under `topology` but the definition of limit of functions etc. had to kept under `analysis`.\n# Iteration II\nBut this gave me and idea to look it with a different light.

Starting at Newtonian _and by extension all of_ Classical Mechanics, \n2. We must deviate from the origin in three different ways:\n    - a Gravitational interaction related with the constant $G$\n    - a relativistic understanding of the universe itself, content in the constant $c^{-1}$\n    - a _amplitudistic_ dynamics of particles and fields that result in Quantum theories, related to the constant $\\hbar$\n3.

    "content": "\n\u003e for building a \"Wiki\" for hierarchical but networked, non-linear notemaking and studying\n\n\u003e [!note] Note\n\u003e \n\u003e A Wiki might have different definitions in other contexts, my definition of wiki might not match with others.\n\n# building the foundations\n\nThe fundamental problem is this:\n\n\u003e Context based notes, for example, lecture notes, book notes, etc. are the first hand-down self-documentation of the topics presented.\n\nThe fundamental philosophy behind this \"Wiki\":\n\u003e After a thorough reading on a subject, writing long-term notes on the learned knowledge is desired. This must be generated free from **contextual bounds** and must be let freely stand on the basis of its conceptual standing.\n\n## further problems that extend the premise\n\n### extremely loose, unstructured set of notes is undesirable\nAn alphabetically sorted notes on topics would be hardly desireable. Unrelated topics with same names would pop up together. Even if all notes are heavily-linked and kept non-linear, it would be a nightmare to actually find some specific note purely by search.\n\n\u003e [!example] Example: similar topics but which differ\n\u003e \n\u003e For every programming language there are the usual data types, classes, etc. which must be separate for each language.\nThus, they must be kept in some sort of a hierarchy.\n\n### highly categorical, rigid (eg: folder-based) structure of notes is undesirable\nStructures must be let changed over time. This is simpler to do when just files under a single folder is concerned.\nThe dilemma of placing notes on topics with mixed-concepts, which is practically all of the Sciences and especially Mathematics, will be a waste of time. The hierarchy must be kept simple and easy. A unending series of sub-folders would not be such an example.\n\n### a mix of the above two is nice\nHierarchy should be allowed to grow naturally. For initiating the wiki, one may choose to divide by subjects/disciplines, and then by the first level division of topics in the subject, however large in numbers they may be. \nThe lower branches of the hierarchy must maintain a value of looseness without loosing identity structures. The hierarchy headers might give a linear list of topics in a special conceptual manner, but the notes itself might not follow those divisions.\nThere maybe two places a note can be, if one relationship can not be prioritised over the other, one can loosen the hierarchy and let the note reside above (or create a or more fake-parents using tags).\nAlso, one possible factor that maybe chosen: the hierarchy, even at discipline level must be cascading style. This means they are ordered from more general topics to specialised ones.\n\n\u003e [!example] Example: Cascading style disciplines\n\u003e \n\u003e There is no real solid wall in the scientific community, hence a personal convention can be applied. All study abstract physical systems, models and theoretical applications can be placed under \"Physics\" discipline. And thus the further practical, experimental or other special applications can be placed under Engineering (like Robotics), Astronomy (like Cosmology) etc. Even cross-discipline fields like Astrophysics can be placed under Astronomy due to this convention. Same for Astrobiology and Astrochemistry, where the abstraction comes as biological and chemical systems for Biology and Chemistry respectively.\n\nThis allows one to have folders for different disciplines.\n### multiple iterations of same topic is undesirable\nThis is encountered while learning topics linearly.\n\n\u003e [!example] Example: Dulpicate encounter of same topic\n\u003e \n\u003e While learning Organic Chemistry at High School Standard, one may learn \"Hydration of Alkenes\" under the header \"Reactions of Alkenes\" and later under \"Preparations of Alcohol\"\n\nThis duplicity is at the core of the nature of the concepts at play here. There may be two tracts (organic reactions and organic compounds) which follow each other and link parts of themselves. One path takes a compound, through a reaction, to another compound. And there are hundreds of reactions that goes back and forth from thousands of reactions.\n\n### choosing the _most balanced_\nIn this manner the right balance between hierarchy, parents, networks, relationships which keep the conceptual nature intact must be obtained. The conventional education and research literature might impose some different approach, which is simpler to teach to beginners, linearly - but that does not mean it follows the objective conceptual approach. It may be historical approach, or just some cherry-picked topics chosen for a final goal.\n\nThe fight is also between reductionism and holism. Reducing a topic to its bare fundamentals is a good approach but by analysing very broad scale developments and similarities of separated fundamentals broadens understanding of the topics.\n\n### densely linked individuals is desired\nTo keep the nature of links hold value one may choose to use them in fields for querying as a database later. \nInterlinked notes can be of help in discovering hidden connection - gaining wisdom!\nTags might be used as a hierarchical fake-parent which cannot be structured onto the notes because the parents' division have an intersect.\n\n\u003e [!example] Example: Intersecting Divisions\n\u003e\n\u003e Several math topics can be put in three of the major divisions - ALgebra, Analysis and Geometry.\n\n\n## quality test for the pieces\n\nHere's a nice thought experiment for a quality check of an individual note or a range of notes on one or many topics.\n\n\u003e [!tip] Hypothetical\n\u003e \n\u003e You have been assigned to give an exam as a part an life-threatening dare where you will be tested on something that you learned 6 years ago. You did not review this subject in the last 6 years at all. You have been given a binary choice of materials you can refer to during the exam: the whole power of every possible books, papers, articles in existence along with the whole of internet vs your entire wiki of notes.\n\nOne should make notes and build the wiki in such a manner that choice easily becomes the latter option, not the former. üòä\n\n\n# Technicalities for implementing this idea\n\n[Dendron](https://dendron.so) has a hierarchy-first approach which is why it contains the best features to be implementing the wiki on. It can be implemented with a combination of Obsidian and Dendron.\n\n## file naming convention\nI prefer the simple `parent.child.grandchild.great-gandchild` style of \".\"-separated namespace hierarchies.\n\n\n# Further developments\n- Building the hierarchies for various disciplines and fields of study: [Hierarchical bases](academic-curation.workstation.wiki.hierarchical-bases)\n\n# Testing of power\n\n**TO BE YET TESTED BY ME ;)**\n\n- *test if this wiki can help to generate new ideas (whatever that means?!)*\n- test if the notes can surprise the author thyself\n\n# Resources\nThe philosophies can be further investigated in:\n- \"Evergreen Notes\": https://notes.andymatuschak.org/\n- \"Zettelkasten\": https://zettelkasten.de/posts/\n- [Obsidian for Students - A Two-Phase Workflow - üå≥ Walk in the Forest](https://walkintheforest.com/Content/Posts/Obsidian+for+Students+-+A+Two-Phase+Workflow)\n- [A Hierarchy First Approach to Note Taking (kevinslin.com)](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/3dd58f62-fee5-4f93-b9f1-b0f0f59a9b64/) and by extension his [Personal Knowledge Management](https://www.kevinslin.com/notes/e9c72b4f-adb8-4f15-a6aa-9f9d81538561/)\n",

    "content": "\n- *Obsidian* is essentially a file editor, like notepad, wrapped around as a note taking tool, with an ambition to become a \"second brain\" for you.\n- It is very customizable and programmable in its functionality and appearance.\n- An ‚ÄúObsidian vault‚Äù is just a folder with files and folder.\n- A ‚Äúnote‚Äù on Obsidian is just a ‚Äú`.md`‚Äù file - exact same as a ‚Äú`.txt`‚Äù file made with a Notepad. Any editor like Notepad can edit `.md` files\n- The learning curve is NOT steep, because you can essentially start with a blank slate with some templates and start making notes. But reaching a crazy good setup requires little patience and lot of time.\n- For readers information, Obsidian is built on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) so the app is essentially all `HTML+CSS+JavaScript` on the inside.\n\n---\n\n- [[notes/why-write-in-obsidian|Why write in Obsidian]] gives some examples where writing in Obsidian is helpful.\n- [[starting-with-obsidian|Starting with Obsidian]] is a long guide on what things to do one after another when getting started with the tool.",

    "content": "\nThere are drawbacks to writing in Obsidian for taking notes for Mathematics and Sciences - be it lecture notes or long-term notes. There are two other possibilities:\n- # **taking notes in *full-on* LaTeX** and keeping them as PDFs\n\t- This is certainly not for everyone.\n\t- One can even compile topic-wise notes and embed them onto Obsidian notes: \n\t\t- ![|550](https://i.imgur.com/Lonjhi3.png)\n\t- The epitome of this would be [How I'm able to take notes in mathematics lectures using LaTeX and Vim | Gilles Castel](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/).\n\t- [^1]\n- # **handwriting them digitally** *completely* and keeping them as PDFs\n\t- This requires a stylus/pen equipped device.\n\t- Again, we can embed the PDFs: \n\t\t- ![|550](https://i.imgur.com/UrETEFk.png)\n\n# Writing in Obsidian using *MathJax*, *Callouts* and *Excalidraw plugin*\nBut Obsidian with MathJax, Callouts and Excalidraw plugin provides the perfect balance between the two:\n- ![|550](https://i.imgur.com/TisLGWB.png)\n\n## further benefits\nWriting in Obsidian in this way provides benefits over each of the individual methods, and more:\n- ### MathJax is as strong as *full-on* LaTeX.\n\t- LaTeX preambles, snippets, conceal, etc. are available from community plugins.\n\t\t- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite/main/gifs/demo.gif)\n\t- There is a plugin for TikZ diagrams too in Obsidian!\n\t\t- ![|450](https://i.imgur.com/GkRRePf.png)\n- ### Obsidian notes and the entire vault is **dynamic and inter-connectable**.\n\t- Between lectures, one can directly **link to previously written notes**, to specific pages in documents in the vault. One can embed them too! To me, this is a superpower! Live preview has made this even better!\n\t- In long-term notes, *block-embedding* callouts is also very nifty:\n\t\t- ![|550](https://i.imgur.com/9Qku4Fw.png)\n- ### Obsidian notes are plain-text.\n\t- That has benefits over storing the content of the notes as PDFs.\n- ### Dynamic queries\n\t- Dataview queries can help create a dynamic table of lecture note details, anything you want to display.\n\t- I used a parameter \"topic\" in the front-matter to list all topics discussed in the lecture. \n\t\t- ![|550](https://i.imgur.com/o4AdbO1.png)\n\t- Tags, tasks can be used intelligently to make use of the dynamic queries!\n- ### Drawing and diagrams\n\t- Excalidraw plugin is a *active-in-development* plugin and even without a drawing device, it can be used to draw figures, flowcharts and also can be used to hand-write notes!\n\n[^1]: [Zettelkasten + LaTeX + VS Code = Productivity++ ? | by Xavier Pinho | Level Up Coding (gitconnected.com)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/zettelkasten-latex-vs-code-productivity-a7deb650608e)\n\n\n## advantages over other tools\n- **OneNote**\n\t- Embedding notes, LaTeX, and way more functionality from plugins.\n\t- Plaintext.\n\t- Files like PDF doesn‚Äôt loose being ‚Äúfiles‚Äù.\n\t- PDFs can be edited externally, linked/embedded to exact page number.\n- **Notion**\n\t- Fast. Offline.\n\t- \n- **Most other tools**\n\t- Free!\n- \n\n## other advantages\n- Various tools can be used alongside it.\n\t- Any text editor like VScode, Atom etc.",
