## Lie groups 



## representation theory of Lie groups

We use Lie algebras to do representation theory of Lie groups.

## representation theory of topological groups

## various groups in topology, geometry and dynamics

- Homotopy and homology groups
- Automorphism groups of
	- Riemannian manifolds
	- Symplectic manifolds
	- Complex manifolds


## Using algebraic topology, differential or other geometries to study groups

AKA "geometric group theory", "Fuchsian groups"

We can use the deas of fundamental groups and covering spaces to say somethings about some infinite groups.
