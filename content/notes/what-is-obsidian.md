- *Obsidian* is essentially a file editor, like notepad, wrapped around as a note taking tool, with an ambition to become a "second brain" for you.
- It is very customizable and programmable in its functionality and appearance.
- An “Obsidian vault” is just a folder with files and folder.
- A “note” on Obsidian is just a “`.md`” file - exact same as a “`.txt`” file made with a Notepad. Any editor like Notepad can edit `.md` files
- The learning curve is NOT steep, because you can essentially start with a blank slate with some templates and start making notes. But reaching a crazy good setup requires little patience and lot of time.
- For readers information, Obsidian is built on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) so the app is essentially all `HTML+CSS+JavaScript` on the inside.
