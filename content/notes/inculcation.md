## start with the little things and the big things

- ### little things: groups (group theory, group actions)
	- ==One should start their journey with groups!==

- ### big things: Vector spaces (linear algebra)
	- [[notes/inculction-linear-algebra]]
- ### [[notes/evan-chen-napkin]]

	- starts with groups and metric spaces!
- ### things in the middle: Analysis
	- definitely start with Tao's Analysis volumes 1 and 2, but for more: [[notes/inculcation#Inside reals and metric spaces|Analysis in $\R$]]

- ### Mechanics and action
	- Never start physics in the conventional road, start right here: ==(short lectures)== [Mechanics using the Action by T Paddy](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlFCvH2vR5kRzC1LQtHy_MUAquC-tQiiW)

## dive into math/physics ✨

- ### continued algebra


- #lectures [Abstract Algebra by Benedict Gross - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA58AC5CABC1321A3)
- #book Artin - Algebra
- #book Algebra Chapter 0


### cute topology and geometry


- #### differential geometry of curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ 
	- These lectures has pre-requisites of linear algebra, analysis in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ #lectures [ICTP Diploma - Differential Geometry - Claudio Arezzo - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLq_gUfXAnkl5JArcktbOrIUeR5rra-Gz) knowing total derivatives and bilinear forms with introducing yourself a little *topology* (compactness, connectedness)

### *handwavey* physics

![|600](https://i.imgur.com/dkGS1Kx.png)


- You can definitely continue with rigorous analysis at this point here (instead of doing *handwavey* physics), it's always an inculcating and ever-increasing skill and knowledge-base: [[inculcation#Rigorous constructions|Rigorous constructions]]
- To to anything *properly* in classical mechanics/quantum mechanics, the theory of analysis in normed vector spaces and  manifolds, measure, ODEs, dyanmical systems becomes important. They are constructed in [[inculcation#Rigorous constructions|Rigorous constructions]], but doing vague stuff first does not hurt - anything for **motivations**!
- One would think while reading these basic books that there are these "untouchable books" which are very far off - while they are actually easy to grasp if basic ideas of manifolds/normed vector spaces are known - things like coordinate transformation, "objects that transform like objects" becomes trivial.
- #### DO MORE CLASSICAL (before quantum)!
	- [[notes/inculcation-classical-physics|Classical physics]]
	- ⭐ [[notes/inculcation-fluid-mechanics|Fluid mechanics]]
	- [Non-linear dynamics by Balki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh4TFzg30eQ&list=PLbMVogVj5nJQKk1E7OUQs_TcW_zQoaO4t) - also substitute this with any ODE+Dynamical system course
	- ##### statistical mechanics
		- definitely do this before quantum
- #### (only if you wanna do quantum)
	- Griffiths Quantum Mechanics if you are an absolute beginner
	- Quantum Physics by Balki
	- Quantum computation - chapters 23-25 from [[notes/evan-chen-napkin]]

### categories, graphs and probabilities

- Category theory - *a new way to think about structures, spaces and mathematics* - critical if you want to start with algebriac topology
- graph theory

## Rigorous constructions

> Now that you see how deep things are, go back and focus on the details

> [!tip] Philosophy: construct spaces and do algebra, analysis, geometry, and whatever we can do!
> - the idea is to *create* meaning, objects out of nothing..., even in familiar spaces and then going to unfamiliar ones!
> - reminder: nothing (even rigor) is more scary than doing wrong stuff!

The order might so something like this

- inside $\R$
- inside metric spaces
- inside vector spaces
	- inside normed $\R$-vector spaces, inner product spaces, or *just* inside $\R^{n}$
- on submanifolds of $\R^{n}$
- inside rings and modules
- inside categories
- out on topological spaces
- out on measure spaces
- out on smooth manifolds
- inside infinite dim spaces
### Inside reals and metric spaces


- #book Tao Analysis vol I, II - this is the best reference for any beginner!
- #book Apostol - Mathematical Analysis
- #book Rudin Analysis (Baby Rudin)
- #### Analysis in $\R$
	- Construct(!!) from $\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R}$
	- Sequences, limits of sequences
- #### Metric spaces
	- Sequences and series
	- $\epsilon-\delta$ limits of functions, continuity
	- get motivated for topological spaces


---

### Inside finite dim spaces

(mostly finite dim)

We do more inside $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and venture slightly out to do analysis in normed vector spaces. This also cascades while doing analysis in inner product spaces.

- #### In normed vector spaces
	- [[notes/inculcation-analysis-normed-vector-spaces|Analysis in normed vector spaces]]
- #### Differential geometry of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
	- #lecturenotes [diffgeo.pdf (ethz.ch)](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~salamon/PREPRINTS/diffgeo.pdf) One can distinguish extrinsic differential geometry and intrinsic differential geometry. The former restricts attention to submanifolds of Euclidean space while the latter studies manifolds equipped with a Riemannian metric. The extrinsic theory is more accessible because we can visualize curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ , but some topics can best be handled with the intrinsic theory...

### *Measure spaces* (measure theory)

> I've no idea yet!


### *Topological spaces* 

AKA the fields of topology, algebraic topology

- Topology (AKA general topology/point set topology) - *as opposed to cute topology, we prove more content here*
	- #book Munkres
	- http://www.math.toronto.edu/ivan/mat327/?resources
	- http://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil/topology-2021/all-lectures/
	- [Topology (MTH-TOP) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp0hSY2uBeP8jgD0wTQM-RjkakSEBdHUD)
	- For a quick one lecture introduction with motivation: [Lecture 1: Topology (International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G4SqIboeig)
- Algebraic Topology - *study of holes in topological spaces*
	- #book Hatcher

> [!danger] Going outside of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for *analysis*: there are two routes
> - *analysis on (finite dim) manifolds* (classical mechanics, ODEs, Hamiltonian systems, oscillations)
> - *analysis in function spaces(infinite dim complete normed/inner product spaces)* (quantum mechanics, PDEs, waves)

### Out on smooth manifolds

> this is the *intrinsic differential geometry* AKA *analysis on manifolds*

May try #lectures [Frederic Schuller -International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_) without any other context or to get into it fully: [[notes/inculcation-smooth-manifolds]].

### Inside not finite dim spaces 

AKA functional analysis!

Of course, I've no idea about this.
- #lectures Frederic Schuller - Quantum Theory

## apply your new-found knowledge: new way of looking at things never ends ✨

With the language of manifolds/normed vector spaces we can work in geometry, topology and physics properly! (no handwaves!)

- Riemannian geometry, semi-Riemannian geometry, GR
- ODEs [[notes/inculcation-odes|Inculcation: ODEs]]
- Ergodic theory
- PDEs
- ==talk== [Mathematics of Turbulent Flows: A Million Dollar Problem! by Edriss S Titi - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH4oawCiHPU)
- Hamiltonian systems and symplectic geometry
- Thermodynamic systems, ODEs and contact geometry
- QM
- ==lecturenotes== Use measure theory to do [Classical Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/stefan_adams/lecturenotestvi/cdias-adams-30.pdf)
- Differential topology, or algebriac topology with a differential viewpoint
- Probability, information theory

# How to study?
- ## How to do lectures?
	- Use https://obsidian.md to organize the amount of content/
		- Copy the lecture note
		- Complete each lecture and tick the check box.
	- Make lecture notes
		- in Obsidian.
			- you’ll need to learn LaTeX and probably will need a drawing tablet
		- in physical notebook.
			- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault.
			- Might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
		- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.
- ## How to do books?
	- honestly I've no idea
