## start with the little things and the big things

- ### little things: groups (group theory, group actions)
	- One should start their journey with groups!
	- [Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE)
	- [Essence of Group Theory - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcSwjT2BF_VuNbn8HiHZKKy59SgnIAeO)
	- Chapter 1 and 3 from [[notes/evan-chen-napkin]]
- ### big things: Vector spaces (linear algebra)
	- [[notes/inculction-linear-algebra]]

---
- [[notes/evan-chen-napkin]]
	- an introduction to a lots of fields of math! (NOT a textbook but a really nice book)
	- starts with groups and metric spaces!

 [[notes/inculcation#Inside dim - - 1 spaces|Analysis in $\R$]]
 
- ### Anaysis and linear algebra in $\mathbb{R}^n$
	- from [[notes/evan-chen-napkin]]
		- Chapters 26-30 - Calculus 101
		- Chapters 42-45 - Total derivatives and differential forms
		- Chapters 2, 6-8 - Topology
	- [[notes/shifrin-multivariable-mathematics]] - a 2 semester course/book that covers linear algebra and (proper) multivariable calc
---

- ### Classical mechanics, a bit of statistical and chaos
	- sadly no "really good" references can be used now/Morin, Goldstein etc all okayish
		- try doing (Newtonian mechanics)
			- rigid bodies
			- central forces
			- n-body problem with different force laws
				- #question Which force law produces simple solutions for the n-body problem? ~~Hint: Newton answers this in principia~~

## dive into math/physics ✨
- ### Algebra
	- #lectures [Abstract Algebra by Benedict Gross - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA58AC5CABC1321A3)
	- #book Artin - Algebra
	- #book Algebra Chapter 0
- ### cute topology
- ### Differential geometry in $\mathbb{R}^3$ proper with introducing yourself *cute topology*
	- These lectures below has pre-requisites of basic topology and linear algebra, analysis in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ #lectures [ICTP Diploma - Differential Geometry - Claudio Arezzo - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLq_gUfXAnkl5JArcktbOrIUeR5rra-Gz)
- You can definitely continue with rigorous analysis at this point here (instead of doing *handwavey* physics), it's always an inculcating and ever-increasing skill and knowledge-base: [[inculcation#Rigorous constructions|Rigorous constructions]]
- ### *handwavey* physics
	- ### I DECREE: DO MORE CLASSICAL!
		- [[notes/inculcation-fluid-mechanics|Fluid mechanics]]
	- ### (only if you wanna do quantum)
		- Quantum Physics by Balki
		- Quantum computation - chapters 23-25 from [[notes/evan-chen-napkin]]
- Category theory - *a new way to think about structures, spaces and mathematics*
- graph theory

## Rigorous constructions

> Now that you see how deep things are, go back and focus on the details

> [!tip] Philosophy: construct spaces and do algebra, analysis, geometry, and whatever we can do!
> - the idea is to *create* meaning, objects out of nothing..., even in familiar spaces and then going to unfamiliar ones!
> - reminder: nothing (even rigor) is more scary than doing wrong stuff!

### Inside dim = 1 spaces
(and  a little metric space more)

- #book Tao Analysis vol I, II
- #book Apostol - Mathematical Analysis
- #book Rudin Analysis (Baby Rudin)
- Content
	- Construct(!!) reals from integers -> rationals
	- Metric spaces
	- Sequences and series
	- $\epsilon-\delta$ limits of functions, continuity

### Inside normed vector spaces
(mostly finite dim)

We do more inside $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and venture out to do analysis in normed vector spaces. This also cascades while doing analysis in inner product spaces.

- ### [[notes/inculcation-analysis-normed-vector-spaces|Analysis in normed vector spaces]]
- #### Differential geometry of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
	- #lecturenotes [diffgeo.pdf (ethz.ch)](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~salamon/PREPRINTS/diffgeo.pdf) One can distinguish extrinsic differential geometry and intrinsic differential geometry. The former restricts attention to submanifolds of Euclidean space while the latter studies manifolds equipped with a Riemannian metric. The extrinsic theory is more accessible because we can visualize curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ , but some topics can best be handled with the intrinsic theory...

---

### *Measure spaces* (measure theory)
<ahem.>




### *Topological spaces* (topology, algebraic topology)

- Topology (AKA general topology/point set topology) - *as opposed to cute topology, we prove more content here*
	- #book Munkres
- Algebraic Topology - *study of holes in topological spaces*
	- #book Hatcher

---

> [!danger] Going outside of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for *analysis*: there are two routes
> - *analysis on manifolds* (classical mechanics, ODEs, Hamiltonian systems)
> - *analysis in normed vector spaces (eg: function spaces)* (quantum mechanics, PDEs)

### Out on smooth manifolds
> this is the *intrinsic differential geometry* AKA analysis on manifolds

- philosophy of manifold theory I - to go out of submanifolds
- philosophy of manifold theory II - to be coordinate-free
- #book Lee - Smooth manifolds
- #book Boothby - manifolds
- #lectures [Frederic Schuller -International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_)

### Inside dim $=\infty$ spaces (functional analysis)
- ofcourse I've no idea about this
- #lectures Frederic Schuller - Quantum Theory

## apply your new-found knowledge
- ### geometry
	- Riemannian geometry
- ### dynamical systems
	- req: topology, manifolds, measure
	- #talk [Mathematics of Turbulent Flows: A Million Dollar Problem! by Edriss S Titi - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH4oawCiHPU)
	- Hamiltonian systems and symplectic geometry
	- PDEs
	- Ergodic theory
	- #lecturenotes Use measure theory to do [Classical Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/stefan_adams/lecturenotestvi/cdias-adams-30.pdf)
- Differential topology
- ### GR
- probability

## new way of looking at things never ends ✨
- #lectures [MathHistory: A course in the History of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55C7C83781CF4316)

# How to study?
- ## How to do lectures?
	- Use https://obsidian.md to organize the amount of content/
		- Copy the lecture note
		- Complete each lecture and tick the check box.
	- Make lecture notes
		- in Obsidian.
			- you’ll need to learn LaTeX and probably will need a drawing tablet
		- in physical notebook.
			- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault.
			- Might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
		- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.
- ## How to do books?
	- honestly I've no idea
# more references, roadmaps
- Look here:
