## start with the little things and the big things

- ### little things: groups (group theory, group actions)
	- ==One should start their journey with groups!==
	- [Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE)
	- [Essence of Group Theory - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcSwjT2BF_VuNbn8HiHZKKy59SgnIAeO)
	- Chapter 1 and 3 from [[notes/evan-chen-napkin]]
- ### big things: Vector spaces (linear algebra)
	- [[notes/inculction-linear-algebra]]
- ### [[notes/evan-chen-napkin]]
	- an introduction to a lots of fields of math! (NOT a textbook but a really nice introductory reference)
	- starts with groups and metric spaces!
- ### [[notes/inculcation#Inside dim - - 1 spaces|Analysis in $\R$]]
- ### Anaysis and linear algebra in $\mathbb{R}^n$
	- from [[notes/evan-chen-napkin]]
		- Chapters 26-30 - Calculus 101
		- Chapters 42-45 - Total derivatives and differential forms
		- Chapters 2, 6-8 - Topology
	- [[notes/shifrin-multivariable-mathematics]] - a 2 semester course/book that covers linear algebra and (proper) multivariable calc
- ### Mechanics and action
	- Never start physics in the conventional road, start right here: (short #lectures ) [Mechanics using the Action by T Paddy](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlFCvH2vR5kRzC1LQtHy_MUAquC-tQiiW)

## dive into math/physics ✨
- ### Algebra
	- #lectures [Abstract Algebra by Benedict Gross - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA58AC5CABC1321A3)
	- #book Artin - Algebra
	- #book Algebra Chapter 0
- ### cute topology
- ### Differential geometry in $\mathbb{R}^3$ proper with introducing yourself *cute topology*
	- These lectures below has pre-requisites of basic topology and linear algebra, analysis in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ #lectures [ICTP Diploma - Differential Geometry - Claudio Arezzo - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLq_gUfXAnkl5JArcktbOrIUeR5rra-Gz)
- You can definitely continue with rigorous analysis at this point here (instead of doing *handwavey* physics), it's always an inculcating and ever-increasing skill and knowledge-base: [[inculcation#Rigorous constructions|Rigorous constructions]]
- ### *handwavey* physics
	- To to anything *properly* in classical mechanics/quantum mechanics, the theory of manifolds, normed vector spaces and measure becomes important. They are constructed in [[inculcation#Rigorous constructions|Rigorous constructions]], but doing vague stuff first does not hurt.
		- One would think while reading these basic books that there are these "untouchable books" which are very far off - while they are actually easy to grasp if basic ideas of manifolds/normed vector spaces are known.
	- #### I DECREE: DO MORE CLASSICAL!
		- Mechanics: Newtonian, special relativistic and statistical.
			- sadly no "really good" references can be used now/Morin, Goldstein etc all okayish
			- try doing (Newtonian mechanics)
				- rigid bodies
				- central forces
				- n-body problem with different force laws
					- #question Which force law produces simple solutions for the n-body problem? ~~Hint: Newton answers this in principia~~
			- [[Balakrishnan_Classical_Physics]]
			- #book LandauL volume I
		- ⭐ [[notes/inculcation-fluid-mechanics|Fluid mechanics]]
		- [Non-linear dynamics by Balki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh4TFzg30eQ&list=PLbMVogVj5nJQKk1E7OUQs_TcW_zQoaO4t)
	- #### (only if you wanna do quantum)
		- Quantum Physics by Balki
		- Quantum computation - chapters 23-25 from [[notes/evan-chen-napkin]]
- Category theory - *a new way to think about structures, spaces and mathematics*
- graph theory

## Rigorous constructions

> Now that you see how deep things are, go back and focus on the details

> [!tip] Philosophy: construct spaces and do algebra, analysis, geometry, and whatever we can do!
> - the idea is to *create* meaning, objects out of nothing..., even in familiar spaces and then going to unfamiliar ones!
> - reminder: nothing (even rigor) is more scary than doing wrong stuff!

### Inside dim = 1 spaces
(and  a little metric space more)

- #book Tao Analysis vol I, II
- #book Apostol - Mathematical Analysis
- #book Rudin Analysis (Baby Rudin)
- Content
	- Construct(!!) reals from integers -> rationals
	- Metric spaces
	- Sequences and series
	- $\epsilon-\delta$ limits of functions, continuity


---

### Inside $1 \leq \dim \leq \infty$ spaces
(mostly finite dim)

We do more inside $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and venture slightly out to do analysis in normed vector spaces. This also cascades while doing analysis in inner product spaces.

- #### In normed vector spaces
	- [[notes/inculcation-analysis-normed-vector-spaces|Analysis in normed vector spaces]]
- #### Differential geometry of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
	- #lecturenotes [diffgeo.pdf (ethz.ch)](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~salamon/PREPRINTS/diffgeo.pdf) One can distinguish extrinsic differential geometry and intrinsic differential geometry. The former restricts attention to submanifolds of Euclidean space while the latter studies manifolds equipped with a Riemannian metric. The extrinsic theory is more accessible because we can visualize curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ , but some topics can best be handled with the intrinsic theory...

### *Measure spaces* (measure theory)

> I've no idea yet.




### *Topological spaces* (topology, algebraic topology)

- Topology (AKA general topology/point set topology) - *as opposed to cute topology, we prove more content here*
	- #book Munkres
	- http://www.math.toronto.edu/ivan/mat327/?resources
	- http://math.iisc.ac.in/~gadgil/topology-2021/all-lectures/
	- [Topology (MTH-TOP) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp0hSY2uBeP8jgD0wTQM-RjkakSEBdHUD)
	- For a quick one lecture introduction with motivation: [Lecture 1: Topology (International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7G4SqIboeig)
- Algebraic Topology - *study of holes in topological spaces*
	- #book Hatcher

> [!danger] Going outside of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for *analysis*: there are two routes
> - *analysis on (finite dim) manifolds* (classical mechanics, ODEs, Hamiltonian systems, oscillations)
> - *analysis in function spaces(infinite dim complete normed/inner product spaces)* (quantum mechanics, PDEs, waves)

### Out on smooth manifolds

> this is the *intrinsic differential geometry* AKA *analysis on manifolds*

May try #lectures [Frederic Schuller -International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_) without any other context or to get into it fully: [[notes/inculcation-smooth-manifolds]].


### Inside dim $=\infty$ spaces (functional analysis)

Of course, I've no idea about this.
- #lectures Frederic Schuller - Quantum Theory

## apply your new-found knowledge

With the language of manifolds/normed vector spaces we can work in geometry, topology and physics properly! (no handwaves!)

- ### geometry
	- Riemannian geometry
- ODEs, PDEs
- ### dynamical systems
	- req: topology, manifolds, measure
	- #talk [Mathematics of Turbulent Flows: A Million Dollar Problem! by Edriss S Titi - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH4oawCiHPU)
	- Hamiltonian systems and symplectic geometry
	- PDEs
	- Ergodic theory
	- #lecturenotes Use measure theory to do [Classical Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/stefan_adams/lecturenotestvi/cdias-adams-30.pdf)
- Differential topology
- ### GR
- probability

# How to study?
- ## How to do lectures?
	- Use https://obsidian.md to organize the amount of content/
		- Copy the lecture note
		- Complete each lecture and tick the check box.
	- Make lecture notes
		- in Obsidian.
			- you’ll need to learn LaTeX and probably will need a drawing tablet
		- in physical notebook.
			- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault.
			- Might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
		- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.
- ## How to do books?
	- honestly I've no idea
