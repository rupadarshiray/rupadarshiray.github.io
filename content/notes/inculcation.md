# Driven by Infinite Enthusiasm

- # What to study? Where to study from?
  > (order is not strict, life is very *non-linear*)
- ## start with the little things and the big things
	- ### little things: Groups (group theory, group actions)
		- One should start their journey with groups!
		- [Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE)
		- [Essence of Group Theory - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcSwjT2BF_VuNbn8HiHZKKy59SgnIAeO)

		- an introduction to a lots of fields of math! (NOT a textbook but a really nice book)
		- starts with groups and metric spaces!
	- ### Analysis in $\R$
		- {{embed ((641d830b-938a-487c-a39a-88d9d5016479))}}
	- ### Anaysis and linear algebra in $\mathbb{R}^n$
		- from [[notes/Evan Chen Napkin]]
			- Chapters 26-30 - Calculus 101
			- Chapters 42-45 - Total derivatives and differential forms
			- Chapters 2, 6-8 - Topology
		- [[Shifrin_Multivariable_Mathematics]] - a 2 semester course that covers linear algebra and (proper) multivariable calc
	- ### Classical mechanics, a bit of statistical and chaos
		- sadly no "really good" references can be used now/Morin, Goldstein etc all okayish
			- try doing (Newtonian mechanics)
				- rigid bodies
				- central forces
				- n-body problem with different force laws
					- #question Which force law produces simple solutions for the n-body problem? ~~Hint: Newton answers this in principia~~

	- You can definitely start with rigorous algebra and analysis at this point here, it's always an inculcating and ever-increasing skill and knowledge-base: ((24df46a2-7dbd-4e68-9d3b-6fcb4d02c62f))

- ## I DECREE: DO MORE CLASSICAL!
	- [[driven_by_infinite_enthusiasm/classical_physics]]
- ## (only if you wanna do quantum)
	- Quantum Physics by Balki
	- Quantum computation - chapters 23-25 from [[notes/Evan Chen Napkin]]
- ## Rigorous constructions
  id:: 24df46a2-7dbd-4e68-9d3b-6fcb4d02c62f
  > Now that you see how deep things are, go back and focus on the details
	- Philosophy I: construct spaces and do algebra and analysis
	  id:: 977695ee-4120-4536-b875-6fb25c4772e7
		- the idea is to *create* meaning, objects out of nothing..., even in familiar spaces and then going to unfamiliar ones!
		- reminder: nothing (even rigor) is more scary than doing wrong stuff!
	- ### Inside "dim $=1$" spaces
	  id:: 641d830b-938a-487c-a39a-88d9d5016479
		- #book Tao Analysis vol I, II
		- Construct reals from integers -> rationals
		- Metric spaces
		- Sequences and series
		- $\epsilon-\delta$ limits of functions, continuity
		- #book Apostol - Mathematical Analysis
		- #book Rudin Analysis (Baby Rudin)
	- ### Inside "1 $\leq$ dim $< \infty$" spaces:
		- do more inside $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ / analysis in normed vector spaces 
		  / analysis in inner product spaces
		- #### Algebra
			- Matrix algebra, tensor algebra, exterior algebra
		- #### Analysis in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
			- Total derivative of functions
			- Integrating: Differential forms
		- #### Differential geometry of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
			- #lecturenotes [diffgeo.pdf (ethz.ch)](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~salamon/PREPRINTS/diffgeo.pdf) One can distinguish extrinsic differential geometry and intrinsic differential geometry. The former restricts attention to submanifolds of Euclidean space while the latter studies manifolds equipped with a Riemannian metric. The extrinsic theory is more accessible because we can visualize curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ , but some topics can best be handled with the intrinsic theory. ...

	- ### *Measure spaces* (measure theory)
	- > Go outside of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
		- there are two routes:
			- analysis on manifolds (classical mechanics, Hamiltonian systems)
			- analysis on function spaces (quantum mechanics, PDEs)
	- ### Out on (smooth) manifolds
	  > this is the *intrinsic differential geometry* AKA analysis on manifolds
		- philosophy of manifold theory I - to go out of submanifolds
		- philosophy of manifold theory II - to be coordinate-free
		- #book Lee - Smooth manifolds
		- #book Boothby - manifolds

- ## new way of looking at things never ends ✨
	- #lectures [MathHistory: A course in the History of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55C7C83781CF4316)
	- Category theory - *a new way to think about structures, spaces and mathematics*
	- Topology - *as opposed to cute topology, we prove more content here*
		- #book Munkres
	- Algebraic Topology - *study of holes in topological spaces*
		- #book Hatcher
	- Differential topology
	- Graph theory
- # How to study?
	- ## How to do lectures?
		- Use https://obsidian.md to organize the amount of content/
			- Copy the lecture note
			- Complete each lecture and tick the check box.
		- Make lecture notes
			- in Obsidian.
				- you’ll need to learn LaTeX and probably will need a drawing tablet
			- in physical notebook.
				- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault.
				- Might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
			- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.
	- ## How to do books?
		- honestly I've no idea
- # more references, roadmaps
	- Look here:
