We do analysis, algebra, geometry and topology: there is no actual distinction between their build-up, only in their vibes.

- build the grounds
	- logic: propositional, first order
	- set theory
- build structures on sets (or beyond) and work inside 
	- inside $\Z, \Q, \R$
	- out on groups
	- out on metric spaces
	- inside $\R^{n}$
	- out on vector spaces
		- out on normed $\R$-vector spaces, inner product spaces
	- surfaces in $\R^{3}$, in submanifolds of $\R^{n}$
	- out on rings and modules
	- out on categories
	- out on topological spaces
	- out on measure spaces
	- out on smooth manifolds
		- smooth manifolds with more structures
	- out on infinite dim spaces
- what do we work on?
	- dynamics
	- mechanics
	- geometry
	- algebra
	- topology
	- algebraic geometry
	- number theory
