#### Algebriac structures

- Vector space, linear transformations
- Tensor product of vector spaces
- **Algebras of a vector space**: Tensor algebra, symmetric algebra, exterior algebra

#### Functions
- *Total derivative* of functions between normed vector spaces$$D_{p}f$$
- *Differential forms*
    - Exterior derivatives (generalizing grad, curl and div)$$\text{d}\omega$$
    - Integrating differential forms on chains (generalizing line, surface, volume integrals) $$\int \omega $$
    - de Rham complex, Poincare lemma, etc

> This is me explaining tensors, derivatives and differential forms, focusing mostly on motivation of the philosophy and also looking for no-brain symbolic calculation: [[notes/derivatives-differential-forms-and-beyond-youtube]]

- All of these material is present in [[notes/evan-chen-napkin|Napkin]] but it does not give enough page-length to fully grasp the whole topic, maybe?
