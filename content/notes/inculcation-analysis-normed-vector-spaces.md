#### Prerequisites
- **Algebras of a vector space**: Tensor algebra, symmetric algebra, exterior algebra

#### Functions
- Total derivative of functions between normed vector spaces
- Integrating differential forms on chains

> This is me explaining tensors, derivatives and differential forms, focusing mostly on motivation of the philosophy and also looking for no-brain symbolic calculation: [[notes/derivatives-differential-forms-and-beyond-youtube]]

- All of these material is present in [[notes/evan-chen-napkin|Napkin]] but maybe it does not give enough page-length to fully grasp the whole topic?
- Analysis by Herbert Amann and Joachim Escher
