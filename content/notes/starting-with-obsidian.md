# The Quakes

> the very first of the first stuff
 

> [!tip] The reader is advised to
> 
> - Open a blank vault and make a note
> - Readout the official [help pages](https://help.obsidian.md/) alongside this section.

1. Create a blank note.
2. Writing note on Obsidian uses two modes, Preview and Edit. It can be toggled from top right button.


The first Hotkeys to learn:
- `CTRL+E` - Switch from **Preview** to **edit mode**
- `CTRL+P` - Open **command palette**, to search for various operations to do
- `CTRL+O` - Quickly open some note or create a new one

## Markdown Syntax _(unofficially) Obsidian flavored_

Writing in Obsidian uses basic Markdown syntax. 


```js
// Links and Embeds
```
- link to a note: `[[note]]`
	- embed: `![[note]]`
- link to a heading: `[[note#heading]]`
	- embed: `[[note#heading]]`
- link to a block (specific line) try: `[[note#^`
	- embed: `![[note#^` 
- link to a picture: `![[pic.png]]`
- link to a pdf: `[[file.pdf]]`
	- embed: `![[file.pdf]]`
- link to a specific page of a pdf: `[[file.pdf#page=5]]`
	- embed: `![[file.pdf#page=5]]`
- link to a file: `[[file.extension]]`
~~~js
// Text Styles
**bold**
*italic* _italic_
~~strikethrough~~
> quotes

// Lists and tasks
- Unordered list (Hotkey: CTRL+ENTER)
1. Ordered list

- *full-on* **LaTex**
	- For more rigorous use of mathematical notation and equations, chemical structures and equations, diagrams, we must use the industry standard - LaTex. Various Tex utility software like TexStudio, services, or even Vim can be used to create LaTex documents but for the purpose of keeping a familiar aspect to a unfamiliar wold, we shall use VScode to write LaTex documents and integrate with Obsidian.
