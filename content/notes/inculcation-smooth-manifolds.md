> [!tip] Philosophy of manifolds I: to go out of submanifolds of $\R^{n}$

> After studying submanifolds of $\R^{n}$, or just surfaces in $\R^{2}$, why do we want to think of arbitary sets as "manifolds", as something we can do things we could do to smooth surfaces? Because then *anything* could be a manifolds. Well not anything, but many sets can be attached with a smooth manifold structures. For example, $SO(\R^{3})$ (which is a group or a set of functions really!), spacetime in physics. This helps us do *analysis* in more kinds of spaces, and generalise geometry equipped with differentiation.

Sadly, the definition and introductory theory of manifolds is "complete garbage" [^evan]

- #### a first course to construct the theory :(
	- #book Lee - Smooth manifolds
	- #book Boothby - manifolds
- also uses the theory inside physics
	- #lectures [Frederic Schuller -International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_)
