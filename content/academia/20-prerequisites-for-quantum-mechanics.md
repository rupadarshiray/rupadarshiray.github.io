- parent:: [[academia]]

In a wit contest in Discord, I had to give 20 prerequisites for Quantum Mechanics, so here they are from the top of my head:

1. Fluid mechanics
2. Group theory
3. Heat transfer, thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics
4. Linear algebra 101 
5. Newtonian mechanics (you do NOT know it)
6. Special relativistic mechanics
7. Electrodynamics
8. Action in the relativistic mechanics, Action principle in classical mechanics (okay only basics) 
9. Lagrangians in Relativistic, Non relativistic mechanics, do a bit Lagrangian mechanics
10. Hamiltonian mechanics (super freaking important) 
11. Now bit of play around, do cool casual stuff like Electric circuitry, Electronics, digital stuff, etc etc
12. metric spaces, limits of functions between metric spaces
13. Function spaces, l₁, l₂, L₂,...etc, basics is fine, understand the vector space+inner product structure ~
14. ODEs/PDEs
15. (shouldn't have said 20 pre requisites dyam) how to make khichdi... and usual foods (you'll know if you were in PHY101 group xD)
16. Topology: connected spaces, simply connected spaces// parallelisable, and another term I'm forgetting... 
17. Dynamical systems, Hamiltonian system as a dynamical system, Chaos in dynamical systems, Chaos in Non Relativistic mechanics~ the fun stuff!❤️
18. Be a bit casual now, do some solid state physics, some heat capacity problems, and how Einstein solved em, and what problems it had~ the pre-Quantum stuff too, do that properly~ etc~ i forgo the names, the Plank to Einstein derivation or something
19. Statistical Mechanics.
	- can't stress it enough
		*you'll find Quantum mechanics lurking inside Classical Statistical Mechanics*
			- me, just now
20. Idk just relax ig, take a deep breath
