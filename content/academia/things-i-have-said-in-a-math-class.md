- In _Knot theory_ class, when we were supposed to  "attach a cylinder to a surface", I blurted out we need to *attach a wormhole*.
- In ODEs class, I once said "you can extend every continuous function on the closure of its domain". This is obviously false as the necessary condition on metric spaces is that the function be uniformly continuous.
