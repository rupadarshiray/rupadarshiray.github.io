### introductory lecture videos

- A full course on [Riemann Surfaces by M Khalkhali](https://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/khalkhali/riemannsurfaces.html) with [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFLLJhtIPhRaiJp0jJM648EC6A7swNDKL)
- These lectures assume covering space theory (algebraic topology) and uniformization theory and does (pre-moduli space) classification of Riemann surfaces: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbMVogVj5nJSm4256vuITlsovUT1xVkUL
- [Riemann Surfaces](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fW41197nr/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click) by Jacob Bernstein (bernstein@math.jhu.edu) for MSRI summer school 2014: Complex geometry and geometric analysis on complex manifolds ^yg7hmg
	- Prerequisites: 
		- Knowledge of basic complex analysisâ€”at the level of Ahlfors, Complex Analysis, Chapters 1-5â€”will be assumed. Some basic familiarity with (abstract) surface theory and differential forms will be helpful. However, I will review this material as needed.
	- Reading: 
		- The main text will be Donaldson, Riemann Surfaces; get at http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~skdona/RSPREF.PDF.
		- [Syllabus](https://www.slmath.org/ckeditor_assets/attachments/106/bernstein_hein_naber_syllabus.pdf)
	- Other useful references:
		- Farkas and Kra, Riemann Surfaces; a classical text on the subject.
		- Miranda, Algebraic Curves and Riemann Surfaces; a more algebraic perspective.
	- Week 1: Introduction to Riemann Surfaces
		- Surfaces and Topology
		- Riemann Surfaces and Holomorphic Maps
		- Maps between Riemann Surfaces
		- Calculus on Riemann Surfaces
		- De Rham Cohomology
	- Week 2: Geometric Analysis on Riemann Surfaces
