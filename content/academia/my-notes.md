## Summer '22

Before the start of semester 2, I took notes on quantum physics and non-linear dynamics, which remain incomplete.

## Monsoon '22

In semester 3, I (hand-wrote) notes for the course on differential geometry of curves and surfaces.

- [MTH201](https://rupadarshiray.github.io/academicmatters/IISERM-MS21/MTH201/MTH201-lecture-notes.pdf) - Geometry of curves and surfaces

## Spring '23

In semester 4, I "audited" the course on algebraic topology.

- *Algebraic topology*

## Monsoon '23

In semester 5, I starting [[what-is-obsidian|taking notes in Obsidian]] in class.

- *Set theory and logic*

## Spring '24


Tried taking notes on *Knots* (credited) in semester 6, but they remain incomplete.

- *Knots and braids*

## Summer '24

- [[impa-pdes|IMPA PDEs]]

## Monsoon '24

Semester 7 was the time I fleshed out my note taking very well.
