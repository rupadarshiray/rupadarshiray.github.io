## Finite groups

![[inculcation#little things groups, group actions]]



## representation theory of finite groups

There are different levels to study representation theory of finite groups:

- **before doing finite groups** when one has basic ideas of matrices/linear algebra one may try to ponder on
	- consider a finite set of $n\times n$ matrices which are closed under multiplication and has inverses: 
	- easy example is for an invertible matrix $A$ consider the set $$ \{ I,A,A^{2}, \dots \} $$ this set might be finite or infinite, if this is finite then $A^{n}=I$ for some $n$, then what can we say about the matrix $A$
		- Try to prove that if the field is $\mathbb{C}$ (or any algebraically closed field) $A$ must be diagonalizable.
		- Find what the eigenvalues of $A$ may be if the field is $\C$.
	-  ![[inculcation-linear-algebra#representation theory is just spicy linear algebra]]
- **after doing finite groups and linear algebra** it is easy to study representation theory of finite groups any text like 
	- `book` Artin
	- `book` Fulton Harris
	- `book` Dummit and Foote covers all the introductory theory
- **after doing rings and modules** the same theory hits different, rephrase everything about representations of a group $G$ with its group algebra $\mathbb{C}[G]$
- **after doing commutative algebra**, I *feel* it will give another vibe


## Lie groups 

Lie groups are famous. There are different levels to study Lie groups:

- **after doing finite groups** one may try to study matrix Lie groups, using knowledge of multivariable calculus, it must not be ideal

	- Borcherds always a good idea [Lie groups - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8yHsr3EFj53RWBkiHKoOsTw-dGHAoJ-h)
- **after doing topology, smooth manifolds** you must already know definitions of topological and Lie groups along with their Lie algebras and exponential map
- **after doing algebraic topology** you will start understanding what simply connected Lie groups allow that its quotients by discrete subgroups don't

## representation theory of Lie groups

We use Lie algebras to do representation theory of Lie groups.

## representation theory of topological groups

## various groups in topology, geometry and dynamics

- Homotopy and homology groups
- Automorphism groups of
	- Riemannian manifolds
	- Symplectic manifolds
	- Complex manifolds


## Using algebraic topology, differential or other geometries to study groups

AKA "geometric group theory", "Fuchsian groups"

We can use the ideas of fundamental groups and covering spaces to say somethings about some infinite groups.
