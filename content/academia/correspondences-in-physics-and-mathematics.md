We are concerned with finding patterns

- Galois correspondence
- the correspondence between algebra and geometry
- the Langlands program
- [[the-connection-between-cm-and-qm]]
- the relative langlands program
- the StatMech-QM correspondence
- the CM-Therm correspondence
- AdS/CFT or gauge/gravity
- Mirror symmetry
- marks/grades xD
