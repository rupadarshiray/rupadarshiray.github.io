title: Summer 2025 seminar course on Riemann surfaces (and beyond)
---

A seminar on *Riemann surfaces* by Prof Kapil Hari is organized at IISER Mohali during the summer of 2025. Details follow.

(Possible) pre-requisites:

- Open mapping theorem in complex analysis
- Definition of Riemann surfaces and understanding that one smooth 2-manifold may have multiple Riemann surface structures (such as $\mathbb{C}$ is not biholomorphic to $D$, *different* complex tori, etc)
- History of Jacobi and Abelian integrals

Tentative plan: 

- *June to July*: Essentially some topics from chapters 4 to 15 from _Narasimhan - Compact Riemann Surfaces_
	- sheaves
	- (Etale space) definition of Riemann surface of a global holomorphic function (in _Ahlfors_)
	- Riemann surfaces of algebraic functions
	- Riemann-Roch theorem
	- The Jacobian of a Riemann surface and Abel's theorem
	- [Torelli theorem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torelli_theorem)

Possible references for topics in Riemann surfaces:

- https://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~armin/lect/advanced_complex_analysis.pdf
- Books on Riemann surfaces by (Narasimhan may be too daunting)
	- Forster
	- Miranda
	- [Wilhelm Schlag](https://gauss.math.yale.edu/~ws442/complex.pdf)
	- Donaldson
	- Renzo Cavalieri, Eric Miles (Hurwitz theory)
	- ...a hundred more books and notes available online
- These lectures assume covering space theory (algebraic topology) and uniformization theory and does (pre-moduli space) classification of Riemann surfaces: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbMVogVj5nJSm4256vuITlsovUT1xVkUL
- Elliptic Functions and Integrals, Uniformization Theorem etc: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fW41197nr/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click
