title: Summer 2025 seminar course on Riemann surfaces (and beyond)
---

A seminar on *Riemann surfaces* by Prof Kapil Hari is organized at IISER Mohali during the summer of 2025. Details follow.

(Possible) pre-requisites:

- Open mapping theorem in complex analysis
- Definition of Riemann surfaces and understanding that one smooth 2-manifold may have multiple Riemann surface structures (such as $\mathbb{C}$ is not biholomorphic to $D$, *different* complex tori, etc)
- History of Jacobi and Abelian integrals

## notes

The notes for the topics discussed will be kept here: https://dub.sh/riemann 

## plan

- *June to July*: Essentially some topics from chapters 4 to 15 from _Narasimhan - Compact Riemann Surfaces_
	- sheaves
	- (Etale space) definition of Riemann surface of a global holomorphic function (in _Ahlfors_)
	- Riemann surfaces of algebraic functions
	- Riemann-Roch theorem
	- The Jacobian of a Riemann surface and Abel's theorem
	- [Torelli theorem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torelli_theorem)
- *August to November*: The previous plan was to follow *Ramanan's global analysis* but we shall consider the interests of the participants.
