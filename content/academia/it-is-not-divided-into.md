## it is not divided into mathematics and physics

- (E) Experimental and computational
- (I) Informal theory
- (R) Formal and rigorous theories

How do you build a theory?


## it is not divided into classical and quantum mechanics



## it is not divided into analysis, algebra, topology and geometry
