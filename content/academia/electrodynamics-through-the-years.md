> 4 years with electrodynamics

## 2019 April



## 3 years go

it was the fact that integration (eg: ∇ ⋅ E) on volumes/surfaces work so nicely that that cut each other off when you integrate over smaller volumes vs the whole ; i mean like the divergence theorem etc

the whole small set of equations describing everything, the unification etc

## 2 years ago

the dance of particles and field with their stress energy momentum tensor 

Tᵃᵇ = Tᵃᵇem + Tᵃᵇparticles

it's components  include energy-momentum density: stored in and flown by fields and particles 

and the conservation laws: ∂ ₐ Tᵃᵇ = 0 (not sure) which is like divergence of this field is 0,

more field theory stuff like why  Tᵃᵇ is symmetric etc

action principle describing everything

A = -c ∫ mds + ∫ A ⋅ dx + ∫ F^ab _ab dV

## 1 year ago

uniqueness theorems, how the field is a differential 2-form and the Maxwell's equations are really is set of 2 equations

dF =0
*d * F = J

## now

...
trying to do gauge theory and stuff eventually... let's see
