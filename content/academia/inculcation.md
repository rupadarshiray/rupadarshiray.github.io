# Driven by infinite enthusiasm


This list was made with materials mostly found on the internet, to reduce repetition from my side. All opinions are strictly mine. Because of that, this list lacks topics like number theory, algebraic geometry, graph theory, algorithms, combinatorics, etc.

# What to study? Where to study from?

  > (order is not strict, life is very *non-linear*)

This has five major sections

1. journey starts: [[inculcation#start with the little things and the big things|start with the little things and the big things]]
2. [[inculcation#dive into new discoveries|dive into new discoveries]]
3. a need for clarity and details: [[inculcation#Linear constructions|Linear constructions]]
4. the old discoveries in new light: [[inculcation#new way of looking at things|new way of looking at things]]
5. epilogue: [[inculcation#starting again?|starting again?]]


## little things: groups, group actions

>  ==One should start their journey with groups!==

For "multi-variable calculus" AKA analysis on $\R^{n}$ you can choose to start from:

- **calculus:** [[shifrin-multivariable-mathematics]] - a 2 semester course/book that covers linear algebra and (nice) multivariable calculus
- **analysis:** [[inculcation-analysis-finite-vector-spaces|Inculcation: Analysis in finite-dimensional vector spaces]], and more in [[inculcation#Linear constructions|Linear constructions]]


## mechanics

If you're into physics, start here:

![[inculcation-all-of-mechanics#all of physics, all at once]]

This is how I started! Its the "non-conventional" route, study major building blocks of physics at once because

# dive into new discoveries

The first section had groups, vector spaces and analysis. Now we shall continue and add some geometry, dynamics and physics too!

## continue with algebra


- `lectures` [Abstract Algebra by Benedict Gross - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA58AC5CABC1321A3)
- `book` Artin - Algebra

So essentially what this should entail is more group theory, rings, and modules over them. A good way to bring all of these together is [[inculcation-groups#representation theory of finite groups]]


- `book` Algebra Chapter 0 is a fat book that mixes in ideas of category theory while doing algebra

---

- Discover the field of *algebraic geometry* while doing the last few chapters of Artin. Follow the `book` [Harris - First course in Algebraic geometry ](https://books.google.co.in/books/about/Algebraic_Geometry.html?id=U-UlBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&gboemv=1&ovdme=1&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) for more.
- You'll quickly realise a lot of *rings and commutative algebra* is needed for this. Take help of an algebraist / algebraic geometer near you to continue further!

---

Another subject is Galois theory which is broadly missing from Artin. Try this fat book:

- `book` Dummit and Foote - Algebra



## continue with analysis

After [[inculcation-linear-constructions#Inside the reals and metric spaces|the reals and metric spaces]] we move onto [[inculcation-analysis-finite-vector-spaces|finite-dimensional vector spaces]] or just $\R^{n}$:

- (measure theory) [[inculcation-analysis-finite-vector-spaces#measurable functions and their integrals]]
- (differential forms) [[inculcation-analysis-finite-vector-spaces#differential forms their integration and exterior derivative]]
- (complex analysis) [[inculcation-analysis-finite-vector-spaces#in complex vector spaces]]

## differential geometry of curves and surfaces

AKA what I would call "*spicy multi-variable calculus in dimension 3"*!

- `book` do Carmo - Differential geometry of curves and surfaces
- `lectures` [ICTP Diploma - Differential Geometry - Claudio Arezzo - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLq_gUfXAnkl5JArcktbOrIUeR5rra-Gz) 
	- These lectures has pre-requisites of basic linear algebra, analysis in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$, knowing total derivatives and bilinear forms with introducing yourself a little *topology* (compactness, connectedness).
	- Does a bit of [[inculcation-smooth-manifolds|manifolds]] at the end!

## start some *cute* topology

- [Topology & Geometry by Dr Tadashi Tokieda - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTBqohhFNBE_09L0i-lf3fYXF5woAbrzJ)
- Knot theory
	- [How The Most Useless Branch of Math Could Save Your Life - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DBhTXM_Br4&t=246s)
	- [Knot Theory - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOROtRhtegr4c1H1JaWN1f6J_q1HdWZOY)

![[visualizing-higher-dimensions]]

- how topology affects and interacts with geometry, analysis, algebra (Lie groups, say) and physics
	- [Gauss–Bonnet theorem - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem)
	- [Dirac's belt trick, Topology, and Spin ½ particles - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZC_XEyg9U)
	- [The derivative isn't what you think it is. - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ptFnIj71SM)


## dynamical systems and ODEs

![[inculcation-odes#interpret any general ODE as a vector field and study it visually]]



![[inculcation-odes#much elementary introduction]]

![[inculcation-odes#formal theory of ODEs]]

More on this: [[inculcation-odes]]
## probability and information


Well, I have no idea yet!

## continue with *handwavey* physics

Be warned:

![|400](https://i.imgur.com/dkGS1Kx.png)

but start with [[inculcation-all-of-mechanics]]


<!---

- You can definitely continue with rigorous analysis at this point here (instead of doing *handwavey* physics), it's always an inculcating and ever-increasing skill and knowledge-base: [[inculcation#Linear constructions|Rigorous constructions]]
- To to anything *properly* in classical mechanics/quantum mechanics, the theory of analysis in normed vector spaces and  manifolds, measure, ODEs, dyanmical systems becomes important. They are constructed in [[inculcation#Linear constructions|Rigorous constructions]], but doing vague stuff first does not hurt - anything for **motivations**!
- One would think while reading these basic books that there are these "untouchable books" which are very far off - while they are actually easy to grasp if basic ideas of manifolds/normed vector spaces are known - things like coordinate transformation, "objects that transform like objects" becomes trivial.



- #### DO MORE CLASSICAL (before quantum)!
	- [[inculcation-classical-physics|Classical physics]]
	- ⭐ [[inculcation-fluid-mechanics|Fluid mechanics]]
	- [Non-linear dynamics by Balki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh4TFzg30eQ&list=PLbMVogVj5nJQKk1E7OUQs_TcW_zQoaO4t) - also substitute this with any ODE+Dynamical system course
	- ##### statistical mechanics
		- definitely do this before quantum
- #### (only if you wanna do quantum)
	- Griffiths Quantum Mechanics if you are an absolute beginner

# starting again?

- `lectures` [MathHistory: A course in the History of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55C7C83781CF4316) (although be aware, the instructor doesn't believe that $\R$ exists)


# How to study?

- Make lecture notes.
- Taking notes in [[obsidian-and-latex|Obsidian]]
	- you’ll need to learn bit of LaTeX and probably will need a drawing tablet
- Taking notes in a physical notebook
	- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault. This might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process, it seems ro me. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.
