This list was made with materials mostly found on the internet, to give say what I want completely without repetition, etc.

# What to study? Where to study from?

This has five major sections
1. journey starts: [[inculcation#start with the little things and the big things|start with the little things and the big things]]
2. discoveries: [[inculcation#dive into mathphysics -|dive into math physics ✨]]
3. a need for clarity and details: [[inculcation#Linear constructions|Linear constructions]]
4. the old discoveries in new light: [[inculcation#apply your new-found knowledge new way of looking at things never ends-|apply your new-found knowledge new way of looking at things never ends ✨]]
5. epilogue: [[inculcation#starting again?|starting again?]]

## start with the little things and the big things

- ### little things: groups (group theory, group actions)
	- ==One should start their journey with groups!==
	- [Group theory, abstraction, and the 196,883-dimensional monster - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH0oCDa74tE)
	- [Essence of Group Theory - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDcSwjT2BF_VuNbn8HiHZKKy59SgnIAeO)
	- Chapter 1 and 3 from [[evan-chen-napkin]]
- ### big things: Vector spaces (linear algebra)
	- start here: [[inculcation-linear-algebra]]

A very good place to start is this

![[evan-chen-napkin]]

- ### things in the middle: Analysis
	- definitely start with Tao's Analysis volumes 1 and 2, but for more: [[inculcation#Inside reals and metric spaces|Analysis in $\R$]]
	- #### Anaysis and linear algebra in $\mathbb{R}^n$
		- from [[evan-chen-napkin]]
			- Chapters 26-30 - Calculus 101
			- Chapters 42-45 - Total derivatives and differential forms
			- Chapters 2, 6-8 - Topology
		- [[shifrin-multivariable-mathematics]] - a 2 semester course/book that covers linear algebra and (proper) multivariable calc
	- more in [[inculcation#Linear constructions|Rigorous constructions]]
- ### Mechanics
	- Start here: [[inculcation-all-of-mechanics]]


## dive into math/physics ✨

The first section had groups, vector spaces and analysis. Now we shall continue and add some geometry, dynamics and physics too!

### continue with algebra


- #lectures [Abstract Algebra by Benedict Gross - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA58AC5CABC1321A3)
- #book Artin - Algebra
- #book Algebra Chapter 0

### continue real analysis

After

![[inculcation-linear-constructions#Inside reals and metric spaces]]

we move onto [[inculcation-analysis-finite-vector-spaces|finite-dimensional vector spaces]] or just $\R^{n}$.


### cute topology and geometry


- #### differential geometry of curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ 
	- *spicy multi-variable calculus in dimension 3!*
	- These lectures has pre-requisites of linear algebra, analysis in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ #lectures [ICTP Diploma - Differential Geometry - Claudio Arezzo - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLq_gUfXAnkl5JArcktbOrIUeR5rra-Gz) knowing total derivatives and bilinear forms with introducing yourself a little *topology* (compactness, connectedness)
- #### cute topology
	- [Topology & Geometry by Dr Tadashi Tokieda - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTBqohhFNBE_09L0i-lf3fYXF5woAbrzJ)
	- Knot theory
		- [How The Most Useless Branch of Math Could Save Your Life - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DBhTXM_Br4&t=246s)
		- [Knot Theory - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOROtRhtegr4c1H1JaWN1f6J_q1HdWZOY)
- how topology affects geometry, analysis, algebra (Lie groups, say) and physics
	- [Dirac's belt trick, Topology, and Spin ½ particles - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACZC_XEyg9U)
	- [The derivative isn't what you think it is. - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ptFnIj71SM)


### dynamical systems and ODEs


More on this: [[inculcation-odes]]

### probability and information



### *handwavey* physics

![|600](https://i.imgur.com/dkGS1Kx.png)

- Start with [[inculcation-all-of-mechanics]]
- Definitely do more math: lie groups, representations, fluid dynamics, and classical mechanics etc before quantum.


<!---

- You can definitely continue with rigorous analysis at this point here (instead of doing *handwavey* physics), it's always an inculcating and ever-increasing skill and knowledge-base: [[inculcation#Linear constructions|Rigorous constructions]]
- To to anything *properly* in classical mechanics/quantum mechanics, the theory of analysis in normed vector spaces and  manifolds, measure, ODEs, dyanmical systems becomes important. They are constructed in [[inculcation#Linear constructions|Rigorous constructions]], but doing vague stuff first does not hurt - anything for **motivations**!
- One would think while reading these basic books that there are these "untouchable books" which are very far off - while they are actually easy to grasp if basic ideas of manifolds/normed vector spaces are known - things like coordinate transformation, "objects that transform like objects" becomes trivial.



- #### DO MORE CLASSICAL (before quantum)!
	- [[inculcation-classical-physics|Classical physics]]
	- ⭐ [[inculcation-fluid-mechanics|Fluid mechanics]]
	- [Non-linear dynamics by Balki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh4TFzg30eQ&list=PLbMVogVj5nJQKk1E7OUQs_TcW_zQoaO4t) - also substitute this with any ODE+Dynamical system course
	- ##### statistical mechanics
		- definitely do this before quantum
- #### (only if you wanna do quantum)
	- Griffiths Quantum Mechanics if you are an absolute beginner
	- Quantum Physics by Balki
	- Quantum computation - chapters 23-25 from [[evan-chen-napkin]]

## Linear constructions

![[inculcation-linear-constructions]]


## apply your new-found knowledge: new way of looking at things never ends ✨

With the language of manifolds/normed vector spaces we can work in geometry, topology and physics properly! (no handwaves!)

- Riemannian geometry, semi-Riemannian geometry, GR
- ODEs [[inculcation-odes|Inculcation: ODEs]]
- Ergodic theory
- PDEs
- ==talk== [Mathematics of Turbulent Flows: A Million Dollar Problem! by Edriss S Titi - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH4oawCiHPU)
- Hamiltonian systems and symplectic geometry
- Thermodynamic systems, ODEs and contact geometry
- QM
- ==lecturenotes== Use measure theory to do [Classical Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/stefan_adams/lecturenotestvi/cdias-adams-30.pdf)
- Differential topology, or algebriac topology with a differential viewpoint
- Probability, information theory

# How to study?
- ## How to do lectures?
	- Use https://obsidian.md to organize the amount of content/
		- Copy the lecture note
		- Complete each lecture and tick the check box.
	- Make lecture notes
		- in Obsidian.
			- you’ll need to learn LaTeX and probably will need a drawing tablet
		- in physical notebook.
			- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault.
			- Might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
		- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.
- ## How to do books?
	- honestly I've no idea
