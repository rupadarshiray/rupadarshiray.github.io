> Coming from the main article: [[inculcation]], you have seen how deep things are. So now we go back and focus on the details.

## starting out

Life is very non-linear, but arguments should not be circular.

We start with logic and set theory, do analysis, algebra, geometry and topology: there is no actual distinction between their build-up, only in their vibes.

- build the grounds
	- construct propositional logic
	- construct first order based on propositional logic
	- construct ZFC set theory based on first order logic
- build structures on sets (or beyond) and work inside
	- inside $\Z, \Q, \R$
	- studying [[inculcation-groups|groups]]
	- out on metric spaces
	- inside $\R^{n}$ or vector spaces
		- out on normed $\R$-vector spaces, inner product spaces
	- out on rings and fields
	- in graphs
	- out on categories
	- [[inculcation-linear-constructions#Out on topological spaces|Out on topological spaces]]

- #### Metric spaces with the intuition of $\R$
	- Sequences and series
	- $\epsilon-\delta$ limits of functions, continuous functions
	- *get motivated for topological spaces*: prove the theorem that a function is continuous if and only if preimage of open sets is open

## Inside finite dim vector spaces

We do more inside $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and venture slightly out to do analysis in finite-dim real normed vector spaces, which are of course linearly bijective to $\R^{n}$.

> [!note] Diffferential geometry of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
> `lecturenotes` [diffgeo.pdf (ethz.ch)](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~salamon/PREPRINTS/diffgeo.pdf) *One can distinguish extrinsic differential geometry and intrinsic differential geometry. The former restricts attention to submanifolds of Euclidean space while the latter studies manifolds equipped with a Riemannian metric. The extrinsic theory is more accessible because we can visualize curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ , but some topics can best be handled with the intrinsic theory...*

But a better thing to do is directly jump to [[inculcation-linear-constructions#Out on smooth manifolds|smooth manifolds]] altogether...

## Living completely outside $\R^{n}$

> [!danger] Going outside of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (or finite dim vector spaces) for *analysis*: there are two routes
> - *analysis on (finite dim) manifolds* (comes up in classical mechanics, ODEs, Hamiltonian systems, oscillations)
> - *analysis in function spaces(infinite dim complete normed/inner product spaces)* (comes up in quantum mechanics, PDEs, waves) ^bggpgh

## Over rings

AKA *rings and modules*

There are usually three

- **first course on rings and modules**
- **commutative algebra**
- **(non-commutative) algebraic structures**

## representation theory of finite groups

There are different levels to study representation theory of finite groups:

- **before doing finite groups** when one has basic ideas of matrices/linear algebra one may try to ponder on
	- consider a finite set of $n\times n$ matrices which are closed under multiplication and has inverses: 
	- easy example is for an invertible matrix $A$ consider the set $$ \{ I,A,A^{2}, \dots \} $$ this set might be finite or infinite, if this is finite then $A^{n}=I$ for some $n$, then what can we say about the matrix $A$
		- Try to prove that if the field is $\mathbb{C}$ (or any algebraically closed field) $A$ must be diagonalizable.
		- Find what the eigenvalues of $A$ may be if the field is $\C$.
	-  ![[inculcation-linear-algebra#representation theory is just spicy linear algebra]]
- **after doing finite groups and linear algebra** it is easy to study representation theory of finite groups any text like 
	- `book` Artin
	- `book` Fulton Harris
	- `book` Dummit and Foote covers all the introductory theory
- **after doing rings and modules** the same theory hits different, rephrase everything about representations of a group $G$ with its group algebra $\mathbb{C}[G]$
- **after doing commutative algebra**, I *feel* it will give another vibe


## Over fields

AKA *fields and galois theory*



## Out on measure spaces

AKA abstract measure theory, probability theory



## Out on topological spaces

AKA the fields of topology, algebraic topology

## Out on smooth manifolds

AKA *"intrinsic differential geometry"* or *analysis on manifolds*.

May try `lectures` [Frederic Schuller -International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_) without any other context or to get into it fully: [[inculcation-smooth-manifolds]].


## Inside infinite dim spaces

AKA *functional analysis*!


- `lectures` Frederic Schuller - Quantum Theory
- https://www.kryakin.site/am2/Stein-Shakarchi%5D-4-Functional-Analys.pdf
- Papa and grandpa Rudin


## Out on Riemannian manifolds



## Working with topological groups and Lie groups

Lie groups are famous. There are different levels to study Lie groups:

- **after doing finite groups** one may try to study matrix Lie groups, using knowledge of multivariable calculus, it must not be ideal
- **after doing topology, smooth manifolds** you must already know definitions of topological and Lie groups along with their Lie algebras and exponential map
- **after doing algebraic topology** you will start understanding what simply connected Lie groups allow that its quotients by discrete subgroups don't

There are references here: [[inculcation-lie-groups]]


## Out on *algebraic varieties*
