## starting out

Life is very non-linear, but arguments should not be circular.

We start with logic and set theory, do analysis, algebra, geometry and topology: there is no actual distinction between their build-up, only in their vibes.

- build the grounds
	- construct propositional logic
	- construct first order based on propositional logic
	- construct ZFC set theory based on first order logic
- build structures on sets (or beyond) and work inside
	- inside $\Z, \Q, \R$
	- studying [[inculcation-groups|groups]]
	- out on metric spaces
	- inside $\R^{n}$ or vector spaces
		- out on normed $\R$-vector spaces, inner product spaces
	- out on rings and fields
	- in graphs
	- out on categories
	- [[inculcation-linear-constructions#Out on topological spaces|Out on topological spaces]]
	- [[inculcation-linear-constructions#Out on measure spaces|Out on measure spaces]]
	- out on smooth manifolds
		- smooth manifolds with more structures
	- out on infinite dim spaces

## Inside reals and metric spaces


- #book Tao Analysis volume I, II - this is the best reference for any beginner!
- #book Apostol - Mathematical Analysis
- #book Rudin - Principles of Mathematical Analysis (Baby Rudin)
- #### Analysis in $\R$
	- Set theoretically construct(!!), starting from $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$ and then $\R$
	- Sequences, limits of sequences
- #### Metric spaces with the intuition of $\R$
	- Sequences and series
	- $\epsilon-\delta$ limits of functions, continuous functions
	- *get motivated for topological spaces*: prove the theorem that a function is continuous if and only if preimage of open sets is open

## Inside finite dim vector spaces

We do more inside $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and venture slightly out to do analysis in finite-dim real normed vector spaces, which are of course linearly bijective to $\R^{n}$.

- [[inculcation-linear-algebra|Inculcation: Linear algebra]]
- [[inculcation-analysis-finite-vector-spaces|Inculcation: Analysis in finite-dimensional vector spaces]]: total derivatives, measure theory, differential forms, flows, holomorphic functions

> [!note] Diffferential geometry of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
> `lecturenotes` [diffgeo.pdf (ethz.ch)](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~salamon/PREPRINTS/diffgeo.pdf) *One can distinguish extrinsic differential geometry and intrinsic differential geometry. The former restricts attention to submanifolds of Euclidean space while the latter studies manifolds equipped with a Riemannian metric. The extrinsic theory is more accessible because we can visualize curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ , but some topics can best be handled with the intrinsic theory...*

But a better thing to do is directly jump to [[inculcation-linear-constructions#Out on smooth manifolds|smooth manifolds]] altogether...

## Living completely outside $\R^{n}$

> [!danger] Going outside of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ (or finite dim vector spaces) for *analysis*: there are two routes
> - *analysis on (finite dim) manifolds* (comes up in classical mechanics, ODEs, Hamiltonian systems, oscillations)
> - *analysis in function spaces(infinite dim complete normed/inner product spaces)* (comes up in quantum mechanics, PDEs, waves) ^bggpgh

## Out on smooth manifolds

AKA *"intrinsic differential geometry"* or *analysis on manifolds*.

May try #lectures [Frederic Schuller -International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFeEvEPtX_0S6vxxiiNPrJbLu9aK1UVC_) without any other context or to get into it fully: [[inculcation-smooth-manifolds]].



## Inside infinite dim spaces

AKA *functional analysis*!

- (Papa and grandpa Rudin)

## Out on *algebraic varieties*
