What is "dynamics"? A dynamical system is a monoid action on a set.


We reinterpret a lot of math in terms of dynamics:

- [[inculcation-linear-algebra|Linear algebra]] is study of iterations of one linear map on a vector space
- Finite group theory: group action on a set are by definition "dynamics"
- Rings and modules
- solutions ODEs produce a flow map on the phase space which is the "dynamics"
- proof of existence of ODEs using contraction mapping theorem
- machines
