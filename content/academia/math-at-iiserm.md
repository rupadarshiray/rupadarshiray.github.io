I plan to write about

- the core years of math at IISERM
- the major years of math at IISERM [[math-at-iiserm-major]]
- the faculty in IISERM math dept
- why the IISER dream of interdisciplinary undergraduate education failed, imo
- the lost course of MTH201 in IISER Mohali


Following are few fun or informative articles to read:

- [Explanation of Course Structure at IISERM (2012) - Mast Kalandar (imsc.res.in)](https://www.imsc.res.in/~kapil/blog/iiserm/iiserm_course_structure-2012-12-13-08-16)
- [Points don't matter - Mast Kalandar (imsc.res.in)](https://www.imsc.res.in/~kapil/blog/education/points-dont-matter-2017-05-16-22-23)
