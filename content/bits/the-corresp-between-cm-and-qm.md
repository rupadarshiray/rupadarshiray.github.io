This can be said in brief by saying its a Lie algebra homomorphism from a Lie subalgebra $\mathcal{A}$ of observables on (classical) phase space $P$ $$ \mathcal{A} \subseteq( \mathcal{C}^{\infty}(P), \{ \  \} )\to (\mathrm{End}(\mathcal{H}) , [, ])$$
This is precisely what quantization is!

This however, might not be unique, or even exist for any set $\mathcal{A}$.

This analogy can be generalised many folds (geometric quantization of a Hamiltonian group action).


## plot twist: QM $\subset$ Hamiltonian dynamics

For finite dimensions, any anti-Hermitian matrix $i \hat{H}$ (so $\hat{H}$ is Hermitian) can be written as a Hamiltonian vector field of some function $$ H : \mathbb{C} ^{N} \to \R $$ which is given by $$ v \mapsto  \langle v \mid i \hat{H} v \rangle  $$
This can be seen as the following statement $$U(N) \subseteq \mathrm{Sp}(2N, \R)$$ (I think this is correct) where the groups are [Unitary group - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_group#2-out-of-3_property) and [Symplectic group - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symplectic_group#Quantum_mechanics).

Hence, what this means is $$ \text{finite dim QM} \subset \text{Hamiltonian dynamics} $$
This just means we could easily work with Hamilton's equations and the Hamiltonian $H$ rather than the Schrodinger equation with the operator $\hat{H}$.

Notice the Hamiltonian for a operator $i \hat{H}$ is $$ v \mapsto  \langle v \mid i \hat{H} v \rangle  $$ has a QM interpretation!


As a consequence of this chain of thought, I give the example of how two harmonic oscillators and the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle share a phase space $\R^{4}=\mathbb{C}^{2}$ [and their flows commute!](https://www.math.unipd.it/~fasso/research/papers/sc.pdf#page=90)


This can be generalized to infinite dimensions: [Geometric formulation of quantum mechanics - arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00238.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00238.pdf).

What does this mean physically, or even (physics) philosophically?
