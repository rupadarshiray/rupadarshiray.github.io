- I made it up in my head that the composition of $$ M_{4}(R) \isom M_{2}(M_{2}(R)) \xrightarrow{\det} M_{2}(R) \xrightarrow{\det} R $$ is the det map of $M_{4}$! This is not true!
- Compactness $\implies$ sequential compactness for topological spaces.
- Cauchy integral formula (re)constructs a holomorphic function for any boundary value $f\in \mathcal{C}(S^{1})$. However, in truth it does construct *a* holomorphic function $F$ but it may not agree with $f$ on $S^{1}$ at all!
- $$ \partial \bigcap_{n\geq 1} A_{n} \subseteq \bigcup_{n\geq 1} \partial A_{n} $$
Some general misconceptions, that I keep in my head for safekeeping:

- exact sequences do not split in general
