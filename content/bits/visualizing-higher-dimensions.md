A mathematician's reply is

What I do is simply follow

* **step 0**: Picture 1, 2, 3 dimensional vector spaces
* **step 1**: Write $n$ instead of 1, 2 or 3 (imagine n=1,2 or 3 but don't write it down, only use *n*) whenever I am generalizing. Note if we never use the fact that $n = 2$ or $3$, i.e. we write ${e_{1}, e_{2},...e_{n}}$ all the time etc, *pretend* we're working with $n\in \mathbb{N}$ a natural number but *visualize* only 2 or 3 dimensions then our work is done: we have "visualized dim $= n$", by simply forgetting $n=2$ or $3$, yay!
- **step 2**: put $n=$ whatever natural number you like!

That's what a first semester course on [[inculcation-linear-algebra|linear algebra]] is supposed to do initially (after defining the "dimension" of a vector space). This is the algebraic way to visualize things: *using symbols*!

There's a next step for doing functional analysis type stuff:

* **step 3**: Don't even think about *n* being a natural number anymore, it can be *infinite*.

This doesn't help much working with infinite dimensional vector spaces, but alright!

We can generalize "dimension" and "spaces" to things beyond vector spaces: they are called "[[inculcation-smooth-manifolds|manifolds]]". There are many "different" manifolds of a fixed dimension even: a circle and $\mathbb{R}$ (real line) are both manifolds of dimension 1, or "1-manifolds".

2-manifolds are just surfaces: 2-sphere, torus, etc. $\mathbb{\R}^{3}$ is a 3-manifold, so is the "solid ball" 3-ball.

We can't even all 3-manifolds like the 3-torus, 3-sphere (the sphere that lives in $\mathbb{R}^4$) etc.

But I *can* visualize the 3-sphere upto removal of just a tiny a point! The joke/reason being 3-sphere minus a point is just $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ or 3-ball (just like how the usual 2-sphere minus a point is just the disk or "2-ball").
