Today, I am trying to make some statement like this

![](https://i.imgur.com/wnf8E3o.png)

(This guy $u(t,x)$ solves the heat equation on $[0,1]$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions, if that's not clear, we can ask the same (following) question for periodic/other boundary conditions also.)

For any $t>0$ and **bounded sequence $a_{n}$**, $u$ supposedly uniformly converges to a smooth function (even analytic? ^[https://math.stackexchange.com/a/801677/1290493]) in both $t,x$ because of the $e^{-n^{2}}$ factor in the coefficients.

For $a_{n}=1$ we will get a monstrosity like https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kywrkvgap5


So I am looking for possibilities to extend the notion of the initial $$f = \sum_{n\geq 1} a_n \sin(n \pi x)$$ (our domain is $[0,1]$)

- (0) we already know $(a_n)$ in $l^2$ means f in $L^2$
- (1) $L^2[0,1] < L^1[0,1]$, do we have extended Fourier series for $L^1$ peeps?
- (2) bounded sequences should correspond to $L^{\infty}$ functions (finite essential supremum) on $[0,1]$ $\leftarrow$ this could go horribly wrong lmao
- (3) distributions, for eg what's the "Fourier series" for Dirac delta at $1/2$?
