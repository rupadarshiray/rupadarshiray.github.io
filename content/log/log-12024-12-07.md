Wrote my first Mathematics stack exchange answer: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/5008015/1290493.

This came out of my ODEs course, of course. I spent an afternoon trying to come up with an argument for the main claim, which eventually I reduced to the linear bijection of the solution space with $\R^n$.

Interestingly, I used sympy to compute the equation for $x^3, x^2|x|$ and it turns out **all** it's coefficients are $0$. What does this mean? Is this linearly independent pair not a solution of any differential equation? What if there's a pair whose Wronskian coefficients are zero but rest aren't?
