# A lot has happened...

My last log was ends almost 1.5 years ago, at the beginning of my BSMS programme in IISER Mohali.

## semester 1


The story doesn't start here, not yet.
## moving to mohali
This story actually starts on 16th April, '22.
## reluctance to physics, primarily
In May '22, I started to say, jokingly, that I won't take physics major because
- I will be bored because I'd know most of the content at least up to the first major year
- I will benefit more from mathematics major courses because eventually I am interested in *theoretical physics*
- I can teach the content in the physics major curriculum (to whoever wants to listen) and that will mean I will study and grasp the content either way

More I said this to my friends, more I went onto follow it. This was a very neieve ambition initially...

But one needs to consider the struggles I was having with phyics
- Statistical mechanics
- 
## shift to mathematics, majorly
I was interested in math from the fifth grade. This isn't a story of how I shockingly discovered the crazy fancyness/use of the quadratic formula, or the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition or something. I was genuinely studying group theory in the first semester itself, without any though of its real applications *also*. (It really is very satisfying to study it, wish to get back to it this fall.) 

What really struck me first was the construction of $\R$ starting from $\Z$. ...

- Balakrishnan's non-linear dynamics
- Balakrishnan's quantum mechanics
- Fredrich Schuller's two lectures
- a fluids talk
- total derivatives and differential forms

## lessons from MTH201
- courses give discipline 
- courses give confidence
- teaching people brought far more spike than I thought
- manifolds theory really unmotivated without Gaussian geometry of surfaces
- Geometry is so beautiful!!

### the workshop was fun tho


## lessons from MTH410, the lore of manifolds and higher


## other stuff that I did

### academic curiosity and inculcation

### obsidian, wiki, workstation

### how little increments help
<Arkish's statement>

## more stuff I wanna say

### campus life
- the freedom just because you're in a closed community
## plans for summer '23
