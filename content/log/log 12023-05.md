## the year I questioned the status-quo

My last log was ends almost 1.5 years ago, at the beginning of my BSMS programme in IISER Mohali. A lot has happened between January 3, 12022 (day I started the (online) classes at IISER Mohali), and now (end of March, 12023).

## semester 1

The story doesn't start here, not yet.

Still, I studied the following during this time

- real vector spaces
- groups
	- I actually remember the day I learned about cosets of subgroups and thought well vector subspaces (picturing a plane/line passing through origin) are subgroups too, what are its cosets? 
- statistical mechanics
- the problem of a self-gravitating fluid/rigid/gas body, and "ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium"

## moving to mohali

This story actually starts on 16th April, '22.
## reluctance to physics, primarily

In May '22, I started to say, jokingly, that I won't take physics major because

- I will be *bored* because I'd know most of the content at least up to third year
- I will benefit more from mathematics major courses because eventually I am interested in *theoretical physics*
- I can teach the content in the physics major curriculum (to whoever wants to listen) and that will mean I will study and grasp the content either way

More I said this to my friends, more *I went onto follow it*. This was a very neieve ambition initially...

But one needs to consider the struggles I was having with phyics

- statistical mechanics: more I read and re-read the same content, the question of "deriving thermodynamics from Newton's laws" made less sense, moreover there were so many opinions online
- the foundational courses (worldwide, actually) are too trivial


## shift to mathematics, majorly

I was interested in math from the fifth grade. This isn't a story of how I shockingly discovered the crazy fancyness/use of the quadratic formula, or the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition or something. I was genuinely studying group theory in the first semester itself, without any though of its real applications *in any case*. (It really is very satisfying to study it, wish to get back to it this fall.)

What really struck me first was the construction of $\R$ starting from $\Z$, and rigour in real analysis in general. Everything started to feel very different.

Things I followed/studied:

- Balakrishnan's non-linear dynamics
- Balakrishnan's quantum mechanics
- Fredrich Schuller's two lectures
- a fluids talk
- total derivatives
- ifferential forms and exterior derivatives

## lessons from MTH201

- courses give discipline and confidence
- teaching people brought far more spike than I thought
- manifolds theory really unmotivated without (Gauss's) geometry of surfaces
- geometry (and topology) is so beautiful!!

### the workshop course was fun tho

## lessons from MTH410, the lore of manifolds and higher


## other stuff that I did

### academic curiosity and inculcation

### obsidian, wiki, workstation

### how little increments help

One of my friends commented how, by using Obsidian I can learn things by very little increments. This I think is a important bit. One does not need digital note taking tools, just need to have the ability to preserve and recover old notes.

## more stuff I wanna say

### campus life

- the freedom just because you're in a closed community
## plans for summer '23

- Some differential topology, and clear a 'F' grade lol.
