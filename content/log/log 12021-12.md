# HIGHLY Productive Pre-IISER Year *and a half*

The story starts on 18th March, 12020. The Mathematics boards exam has just been over last day. Exam scheduled on the next day (19th) is _Bengali_ exam. At that moment, the government announced Lockdown; which made CBSE announce postponement of board exams.

	- In love with Fluid Mechanics
	- Giving IACS Entrance
- #### September 12020
	- Exam month
		- JEE Main
		- NEST
		- IAT
- #### October-December 12021
	- Unsuccessful to get an institute...
	- Discovery of Productivity Tools
	- Re-inspiration to study for IAT'21
- #### January-March 12021
	- Study and Procrastination
	- Was a out of station for a bit of time, which was of help in mental health. Sitting in home is just… awful.
- #### April-June 12021
	- "*Obsessive Study*" approach and Paper Solving

# Comprehensive academic development during the period
## Comprehensive list of what I have learnt
- **Mathematics**
	- Analysis (including multivariable)
		- Limits ~ ε-δ definition
		- Differential calculus of Several Variables
		- Line, surface and volume integrals
		- Vector, scalar fields
		- Vector calculus
- **Physics**
	- Mechanics in all frameworks and Action principle for dynamics
	- First Principles in Special Relativity and Electrodynamical Classical Field Theory
	- Foundations in Quantum Mechanics
	- Electrodynamical approach to Electromagnetic and Electronic Circuitry
	- Fluid Mechanics
## Things I made up along the way
- Framework notation for Physics frameworks
- a Wiki for Fundamental Sciences using Dendron and Obsidian
## Things I know that awaits me

### Mathematics *thyself*
The enlightenment of "actual" mathematics has brought many "good at math" students to tears as I have heard
> [!quote] [LockhartsLament - A Mathematician’s Lament by Paul Lockhart](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf)
> 
> The last thing they want to hear is that math is really about raw creativity and aesthetic sensitivity. Many a graduate student has come to grief when they discover, after a decade of being told they were “good at math,” that in fact they have no real mathematical talent and are just very good at following directions. Math is not about following directions, it’s about making new directions.
### Physics
- Wanted to get into Quantum mechanics, and Non-linear dynamics.
- But overall, wanted to learn more algebra and mathematics just because without that it’s no help learning physics after a while…
