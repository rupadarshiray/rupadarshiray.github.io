I want for the people in STEM to know what we have known for hundreds of years. everyone. that's it.

## "You shall only need statistics and linear algebra!"

The narrative that the only thing you need as a phy/chem/bio/applied math/anything person is *linear algebra and statistics* is just a **propaganda** by half wit physics and engineering people.

groups, analysis, surfaces were part of the introductory math here for a reason, the ideas learnt in these courses, that you can be precise about intuitive/unintuitive objects is at the core of any applied math/ any "theory" really,

the fact that even elder physics majors can't appreciate this, is disturbing


some do get it during their PhDs.

Why does this duality exist? When it is completely clear the pairs mean the same thing?

> In 1925, Werner Heisenberg came up with a radical new approach to physics in which processes were described using matrices of complex numbers. What makes this especially remarkable is that Heisenberg, like most physicists of his day, had not heard of matrices!
> 
> It’s hard to tell what Heisenberg was thinking, but in retrospect we might say his idea was that given a system with some set of states, say $\{ 1,\dots,n \}$, a process $U$ would be described by a bunch of complex numbers $U^{i}_{j}$ specifying the ‘amplitude’ for any state $i$ to turn into any state $j$. He composed processes by summing over all possible intermediate states:
> 
> $$(VU)^{i}_{k} = \sum_{j}V^{j}_{k }U^{i}_{j }$$
> 
> Later he discussed his theory with his thesis advisor, Max Born, who informed him that he had reinvented matrix multiplication!
> 
> In 1928, Max Born figured out what Heisenberg’s mysterious ‘amplitudes’ actually meant: the absolute value squared $|U^{i}_{j }|^{2}$ gives the _probability_ for the initial state $i$ to become the final state $j$ via the process $U$. This spelled the end of the deterministic worldview built into Newtonian mechanics.
> 
> More shockingly still, since amplitudes are complex, a sum of amplitudes can have a smaller absolute value than those of its terms. Thus, quantum mechanics exhibits destructive interference: allowing more ways for something to happen may reduce the chance that it does!
> 
> Heisenberg never liked the term ‘matrix mechanics’ for his work, because he thought it sounded too abstract. Similarly, when Feynman invented a way of doing physics using what we now call ‘Feynman diagrams’, he didn’t like it when Freeman Dyson called them by their standard mathematical name: ‘graphs’. He thought it sounded too fancy. **Can you detect a pattern?**

We observe how similar it is to the primary reference.

## physics people want "physicality"

can't explain the idea of building theories, ig demanding physicality is a very strong condition is what I'm saying, weakening stonger conditions is what led to all of PDEs and so, so many other stuff.

working in general cases helps! knowing a whole lot of analysis, groups etc helps! Makes you literally think differently!

Be wise! Generalize!

## physics people won't learn analysis, topology, group theory, manifolds, vector bundles

Well skip all that! Be a typical physics major! You wont be able to grasp the answer to many, many questions.

you've to study it to get all of it; which is horrible risk, but thats on you.

How do you answer a kid's question about: if a bee is confined on a cylinder vs a Mobius strip, what difference will it have? **If you do not know, you will give wrong answers only!**

## physics is not gonna get a paradigm shift, I won't need that much math

lol.

## physics people say you're gonna run into problems in future if you strip physics from physics and treat it as axioms+math

the main thing is: generally there's very lil physics in some topics

topics like ODEs (NLD), PDEs, differential forms, tensors, groups, Hamiltonian dynamics.

> If you see things like this then you are going to run in to problems in the future, physics is a lot of interpretation and not really some kind of general framework that you see pop in everywhere.

False in all accounts.

No, physics is not a lot of interpretation. Interpret the topology on the configuration space or spacetime. Interpret the flow preserving some topological properties of subsets (like contentedness) physically? Interpret energy function physically?

Physical interpretation will always be a meta argument (in the sense of propositional logic) and will never help to solve problems actually. You will be hypocritical if teach otherwise. It is fine to teach kids hypocritically, but that does not make it a truth.

General kind of framework definitely pop up. We get set theoretic structures, structures coming with a topology and smooth charts all the time. That has nothing to do with physics, but happens all the time in physics. Why is that? Because we want it to be! We want things to be open sets of $\R^{n}$ because we *want* to use analysis in $\R^{n}$! We want we use analysis in $\C$, that is why we use it, no more, no less.

> If you strip everything sure, there is going to be only math but what lies beyond is a matter of interpretation and comprehension


Mind you topics like statistical mechanics exists where there is a lot of physics happening, and not a lot of fancy math, just calculus and statistics. But eventually... hah, you'll see what happens!


## "I cannot do all these, man. I am \<something>."

"Something" may be poor, depressed, disillusioned of physics or math, thinking you should have just taken up engineering or medicine.

It is understandable. Life is hard. Not everyone is as privileged like some. All the best to you for surviving it! Get help when you can!

## "I still am not convinced."

Of course you're not! [Facts Don’t Change Our Minds](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/02/27/why-facts-dont-change-our-minds). Keep going, maybe you'll see the beauty someday!

For now, let just say it is just a propaganda!

## I loved this! I want to learn more math and physics!

Great! Start at the beginning! [[inculcation]].
